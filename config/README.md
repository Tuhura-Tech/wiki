# `config/`

This directory contains code related to configuring the docs site, which is used in [`astro.config.ts`](../astro.config.ts).

Primarily these are custom Astro integrations (in [`integrations/`](./integrations/)) and plugins for remark, rehype, or Starlight (in [`plugins/`](./plugins/)). Other utilities to simplify configuring the site are also included here.
