Following [PEP 20](https://peps.python.org/pep-0020/) which states that "Simple is better than complex", we will be simplifying our code by using [blueprints](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/blueprints/). Blueprints are a way to organize a group of related views and other code. They are registered with the application and can be used to create a modular application.

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<FileTree>

- app.py

</FileTree>

This gets turned into a tree structure like this:

<FileTree>

- app.py
- blog.py
- ...

</FileTree>

## Creating a Blueprint

To create a blueprint, we need to create a new file called `blog.py`. We will then create a blueprint object and define the routes for the blog.

```python
from flask import Blueprint

bp = Blueprint('blog', __name__)

@bp.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Blog Index'

@bp.route('/post/<int:id>')
def post(id: int):
    return f'Post {id}'
```

:::tip
You can set the path that the blueprint will be registered at by passing the `url_prefix` argument to the `Blueprint` constructor.

```python
bp = Blueprint('blog', __name__, url_prefix='/blog')
```

This will register the blueprint at `/blog` instead of `/`.
:::

We then need to register the blueprint with the application in `app.py`.

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

from blog import bp as blog_bp
app.register_blueprint(blog_bp)
```
