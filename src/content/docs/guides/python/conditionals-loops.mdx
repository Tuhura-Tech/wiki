## If, Elif, and Else Statements

If statements allow you to create conditions for certain code to run. This can make your programs a lot more interesting and varied.

```python
import random

# Generates a random whole number from 1 to 10 using the random library imported above
random_number = random.randint(1, 10) 

# Asks the user to input a number from 1 to 10 as a guess and turns that input into a number
guess = int(input("Guess the random number from 1 to 10: "))

if guess == random_number:
    print("You guessed correctly!")
else:
    print("You guessed incorrectly")

```

You can have multiple conditons before the `else`. For every condition after the first you use `elif`, short for else if.

```python

username = input("Create a Username: ")

password = input("Create a Password: ")

if len(password) <= 8:
    print("Your password needs to be longer than 8 characters")
elif password.isupper() or password.islower():
    print("Your password needs both lowercase and uppercase letters")
elif username.lower() in password.lower():
    print("Your password must not contain your username")
else:
    print("Your password has been accepted")

```

## Loops

Loops allow you repeat code over and over. There are 2 main types of loops, `while` loops and `for` loops. 

A `while` loop will continue repeating code until a certain condition is no longer met. To show a `while` loop, we're going to modify the number guessing game above. As it currently is, you can only guess once before the program ends. That's boring. Using a while loop we can let the user continue guessing until they get it correct.

```python

import random

# Generates a random whole number from 1 to 10 using the random library imported above
random_number = random.randint(1, 10) 

# Asks the user to input a number from 1 to 10 as a guess and turns that input into a number
guess = int(input("Guess the random number from 1 to 10: "))

while guess != random_number:
    guess = int(input("You guessed incorrectly, try again: "))

print("You guessed correctly!")

```

Now the program will continue asking the user to guess the number until they guess it correctly.

A `for` loop lets you loop a set number of times, rather than until a condition is no longer met. Let's create a `for` loop that sums the numbers from 1 to 10.

```python

total = 0

for num in range(10):
    total += num + 1

print(total)
```

Let's break this down a bit. `range` gives a sequence of numbers starting from 0 and ending before the given number. So in this case it gives the number sequence `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`. `num` is being assigned one of those numbers as it goes through the loop which can then be used inside the loop as a variables. The code is saying for each number in this sequence, assign it to the variable `num` and then run the code inside the loop.

There are other ways to use `range`. Notice how we had to add 1 to `num` when summing the numbers, as they started at 0. We can avoid this by giving 2 numbers to `range`.

```python

total = 0

for num in range(1, 11):
    total += num

print(total)

```

This is saying to start the sequence with the number 1 and end the sequence right before the number 11.

You can also tell `range` to jump numbers in a sequence. Let's say you wanted to sum all the even numbers from 0 to 20.

```python

total = 0

for num in range(0, 21, 2):
    total += num

print(total)

```

This is saying to start the sequence at 0, end it just before 21, and skip every second number. The given sequence would then be `0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20`.
