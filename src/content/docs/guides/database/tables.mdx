## Relationships

There are three types of relationships between entities:

-   One to One
-   One to Many
-   Many to Many

### One to One

A one to one relationship is where one entity is related to another entity.

For example, a user can have one profile and a profile can belong to one user.

### One to Many

A one to many relationship is where one entity is related to many entities.

For example, a user can have many posts but a post can only belong to one user.

### Many to Many

A many to many relationship is where many entities are related to many entities.

For example, a user can have many roles and a role can belong to many users.

## Primary Keys

A primary key is a column that uniquely identifies each row in a table.

For example, if we have a `users` table, we can use the `id` column as the primary key.

| id | name  | email       |
|----|-------|-------------|
| 1  | John  |
| 2  | Sarah |
| 3  | Jane  |

## Creating a Primary Key

When creating a table, we can specify a column as a primary key by using the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint.

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  email VARCHAR(255)
);
```

:::tip
It is common practice to use the `id` column as the primary key and to make it an `INTEGER` type.

This makes sure it is unique, easier to reference and more performant.
:::

## Foreign Keys

When we have a table that references another table, we call the column that references the other table a `foreign key`.

An example would be the below schema which has a `users` table and a `posts` table. The `posts` table has a `user_id` column which references the `id` column in the `users` table.


| users | posts |
|-------|-------|
| id    | id    |
| name  | title |
| email | body  |
|       | user_id |



As the posts collumn references the users table, we call it a `foreign key`.

### Creating a Foreign Key

When creating a table, we can specify a column as a foreign key by using the `references` method.

```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255),
  body TEXT,
  user_id INTEGER
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

:::tip
You can also specify the `REFERENCES` clause after the column definition.

```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(255),
  body TEXT,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

However some databases such as [MySQL do not support this syntax](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=17943).

## Table Joins

When we have two tables that are related to each other, we can use a `JOIN` to combine the data from both tables into a single result set.

For example, if we have a `users` table and a `posts` table, we can use a `JOIN` to get all the posts for a given user.

```sql
SELECT * FROM posts
JOIN users ON users.id = posts.user_id
WHERE users.id = 1;
```

The above query will return all the posts for the user with an id of 1.

```text
| id | title | body | user_id | id | name | email |
|----|-------|------|---------|----|------|-------|
| 1  | ...   | ...  | 1       | 1  | ...  | ...   |
| 2  | ...   | ...  | 1       | 1  | ...  | ...   |
| 3  | ...   | ...  | 1       | 1  | ...  | ...   |
```
