Modelling is the foundation for all 3D art, although 3D models on their own do not look good.

Textures, lighting, animation, effects, or several other things are required to make a 3D model look good. But, they require a 3D model to do them.

[Modelling has 3 main modes you'll use](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/meshes/introduction.html):

- **Object Mode**: Arrange various objects
- **Edit Mode**: Modify a single object
- **Sculpt Mode**: Scult objects like clay

Sculpting is its whole own skillset, and is less foundational than editing an object, so we'll start with edit mode.

## What Is a Model?

A model is made up of [3 structures](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/meshes/structure.html):

- Vertex (verticies plural)
- Edge
- Face

![Blender's mesh structure example](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/_images/modeling_meshes_structure_example.svg)

Verticies are the primary structure of meshes.

There are 3 main types of polygons that make up meshes. A polygon is the shape the face makes when it connects the edges connecting the verticies.

4 verticies connected by 3 edges with a face connecting the edges makes a **Quad** (or quadrangle).

3 vertices connected by 3 edges with a face connecting the edges makes a **Tri** (or triangle).

Anything more than that are called n-gons, where *n* is how many verticies in the polygon.

Most meshes will be made with purely quads and tris. [N-gons are not a good idea to use in most cases](https://blender.stackexchange.com/a/95).

A cube, for example, is made of 6 faces, 12 edges, and 8 verticies.

## Edit Mode

In [navigation](../navigation) you worked in **Object Mode**, now we'll work in **Edit Mode**.

In the top left of your screen there's a drop-down, here you can switch to **Edit Mode**.

![Mode select drop-down](/src/assets/blender/modelling/Drop-Down.png)

There are better and faster ways of doing this.

Press tab to quickly swap between **Object Mode** and **Edit Mode**

If you ever need any of the other options quickly, you can use Ctrl + tab to open this radial menu at your cursor:

![Mode Select radial menu](/src/assets/blender/modelling/ModeSelect.png)

### Using Edit Mode

When in edit mode there is another mode selection.

![Vertex edge face selection next top mode select drop-down](/src/assets/blender/modelling/VEFSelect.png)

These buttons let you switch between selecting verticies, edges, or faces.

You can also use the 1 2 and 3 on your keyboard to quickly swap between these modes (if you don't have numpad emulation enabled).

Being in vertex mode allows you to see and select each vertex on the mesh:

![Cube with one vertex selected](/src/assets/blender/modelling/SelectVertex.png)

The other two modes are self-explanatory. With edge mode you can select edges.

![Cube with edge selected](/src/assets/blender/modelling/SelectEdge.png)

with face mode you can select faces.

![Cube with face selected](/src/assets/blender/modelling/SelectFace.png)

### Editing The Object

Now, we can pretend we're in **Object Mode** again.

Select a vertex, any vertex. Use the move tool (press G) to move the vertex around.

Then move (G), rotate (R), and scale (S) an edge and then a face.

You cannot scale nor rotate a vertex because it takes up no space nor has a rotation.

With these tools you can transform the cube into anything with exactly 6 faces, 12 edges, and 8 verticies, anything you desire.

The only thing you're missing on actually transforming this cube into something completely different is creating and removing structures.

#### Removing Structures

Removing is simple, press delete.

![Delete structure menu](/src/assets/blender/modelling/DeleteStruct.png)

You'll be given one of a few options, the others you can ignore for now.

Test them out, they should be pretty self-explanatory based on what you've selected.

It's a good way of getting to viscerally know that edges only connect vertices and do not exist on their own, and faces only exist when connecting edges.

#### Adding Structures

Here's where it gets a bit more complicated.

There are three main ways of creating new structures:

- Subdivide
- New from connection
- Extrude

![Making new structures right click edit menu](/src/assets/blender/modelling/MakingStructures.png)

These three are great for small-scale things where you need to build up a model piece by piece. You can also use the various tools on the left side toolbar in **Edit Mode**.

##### Extrude

Extruding is the easiest, select a structure and press E or right click and press Extrude.

Then, it's similar to using the move tool. Just move your cursor and it will add a new structure and connect it to whichever you had selected.

If you extrude a face it will extrude in the same direction and stay locked, you can click middle click briefly to unlock it and extrude in any direction.

##### Subdivide

The other two require selecting multiple structures.

To select a second structure hold Shift and select another of the same structure you already have selected. 

If you're in vertex select mode and you selected a vertex, Shift + click a different vertex and they will both be selected.

Now, select two verticies that are connected by an edge. 

Then, right click and press subdivide.

Subdividing created a new vertex halfway between the two verticies.

##### New From Connection

Last but not least is creating a new structure between other structures.

If you select two verticies and press F or right click and press New Edge/Face from Verticies, it'll create a new edge.

If you select three or more verticies it'll create a new face.

### Adding meshes

It can be useful to add another primitive mesh (e.g. cube, sphere, cylinder) to the current mesh you're working on.

It's quicker than manually building out more parts.

Press Shift + A or go up to Add in the top left.

Select the mesh you wish to add and it should appear. If you wish to conjoin these meshes use the additive methods described above, primarily new from connection.

If you're in **Object Mode** when you press Shift + A it gives you a lot more options.

If you add a mesh while in **Object Mode** it will be considered a new object, and appear in the top-left outliner as a different object. You cannot edit two objects while in **Edit Mode** so be careful if you decide to do this.

#### Building Familiarity

1. Move, rotate, and scale parts of the cube.
2. Test each of the deleting options.
3. Extrude and connect new faces and edges.
4. Make new edges and faces from connections.
5. Test out each of the tools on the toolbar in **Edit Mode**.

Extra challenge to get really good:

Try making a real-world object in front of you, something that can be made from simple shapes.

It could be a soft-drink can, the monitor you're looking at, your headphones, or practically anything.

You'll want to avoid complex shapes with lots of parts.

For example, a hair brush. It hasn't been covered how to quickly build up lots of those little things, and it'll be a pain to model each one by hand. Keyboards are in a similar boat. 

Any organic shapes are a no-go, don't try modelling a plant or clothes, those are best fit for sculpting.

You'll want to make it in a low-poly style. Most 3D models are actually low-poly models that have had normal maps applied to them from high-poly models.

This means you'll want to stick to making any cylindrical or spherical objects in 5 or 6 segments that loop around.

Think of making a circular object like making a circle with your thumb and index finger. Your fingers collectively only have 6 segments, but they make the impression of a circle even if it isn't a perfect circle.

You can see this best on the default Blender torus shape:

![Default Blender torus](/src/assets/blender/modelling/Torus.png)

This has 16 segments to make the circle, and then 8 segments to make the tube.


## Modifiers

Modifiers are a great tool in Blender's vast toolbox, and there are many modifiers.

To add a modifier to an object select it and go to the Modifiers tab in the properties area:

![Empty modifiers tab](/src/assets/blender/modelling/Tab.png)

There are many modifiers to choose from:

![Generate modifiers](/src/assets/blender/modelling/Generate.png)

This is just the generate categories, there are many more as you can tell by there being more categories.

We'll only need a handful but it's good to familiarize yourself with what's possible.

Modifiers have 2 steps:

- First, you need to add the modifier to the object. 

In the viewport, you should see what the model will look like after the modifier has been applied.

However, when you edit the object you may notice that nothing has changed and verticies are not lining up with the model you see.

That's because it hasn't been applied yet.

- The second step is applying it.

When you apply it there's no going back (aside from undo).

You can no longer edit the modifier and the changes have been permanently made to the object.

### Mirror

If you're making a symmetrical object, the mirror modifier literally saves you half the time of making your creation.

Let's start by mirroring the cube so we only need to work on half of it.

You can subdivide a cube with a loop cut. There is a loop cut tool in **Edit Mode** on the left side. Find it by hovering over each icon until you find it, or find the icon that looks similar to this cube:

![Cube subdivided down the middle](/src/assets/blender/modelling/CutCube.png)

Subdivide your cube down the middle by using loop cut.

Select half of the verticies on the cube and delete them.

![Four verticies selected for deletion](/src/assets/blender/modelling/DeleteHalf.png)

:::note[Complex shapes]
If you are trying to use mirror on something more complex than a cube you can select all verticies on one half by using X-ray, then clicking and dragging with the Select Box tool.

X-ray allows you to select structures through the object.

Use Alt + Z to toggle X-ray, or find the button in the top right of the viewport.
:::

Now, add the mirror modifier in the modifier tab.

You will most likely need to change the axis that it's mirroring. The example cube I'm using needed to be mirrored on the Y axis.

The half you just deleted should reappear, although you will not be able to select any verticies.

This is because none of the verticies are real, it is only a representation of what it will look like if you apply the modifier.

![Mirrored cube](/src/assets/blender/modelling/Mirrored.png)

You will likely also want to enable clipping.

Clipping makes it so that the verticies in the middle between the two halves cannot move away from the half, this makes it so you won't have gaps in your model when you finally apply the modifier.

From here, go ham and edit the model as you desire, it saves a lot of time when making symmetrical models.

### Subdivision Surface

Subdivision surface is a simple modifier, it subdivides every face into more faces.

Make a new cube to work on in **Object Mode** and move it away from the mirrored cube if you had one so you can work on this one seperately.

Subdivision surface is one of the best ways to make a sphere in Blender.

:::note[Types of 3D sphere]
The two types of spheres you can make by default in blender are UV Spheres and Ico Spheres.

![The three main kinds of spheres](/src/assets/blender/modelling/SphereTypes.png)

UV Spheres (bottom left) end in 'poles', which is tough to model around and makes the shape non-uniform.

Ico Spheres (bottom right) are made of triangles, which makes them [non-ideal for animation](https://blender.stackexchange.com/a/2939).

Subdivided Cubes (top middle) are the best way to quickly get what you need and not give up future possibilities.
:::

Add the subdivision surface modifier to the cube. 

![Subdivided cube](/src/assets/blender/modelling/SubdividedCube.png)

Increase Levels Viewport to change how many times it's cut. Do not make this number go very high, it may crash Blender.

If you change the mode from Catmull-Clark to Simple it will not bring the edges in to make it smoother, it still increases how many polygons are in the mesh.

Simple subdivision surface is only visible in **Edit Mode** after you apply the modifier.

### Applying Modifiers

To apply a modifier you need to go back to **Object Mode** with tab.

Then, press the drop down arrow and then apply. It's as simple as that.

![Mirror modifier with apply drop down opened](/src/assets/blender/modelling/ApplyMirror.png)

You cannot apply modifiers while in **Edit Mode**.

#### Building Familiarity

1. Make a sphere with subdivision surface.
2. Cut the sphere into a quarter or eighth and use the mirror modifier to make it so you only need to edit the quarter/eighth to edit the whole sphere.
3. Try a dozen or so other modifiers! There are some fun ones in there. See what is available to you.
