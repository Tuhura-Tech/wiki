We can install pytest inside our Python virtual environment using

```python
pip install -U pytest
```

We'll then want to create a new folder called "tests"

and inside that, create a new file called 'test_pytest.py'

:::[File names]
Pytest looks for files with names that either start with test_ or end with _test, so it's important that this file is named correctly
