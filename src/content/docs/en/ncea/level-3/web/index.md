These guides will cover the required content for achieving the [NCEA level 3 web internal](https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/ncea-resource/achievements/2024/as91902.pdf)

These will build on the blog created for the level 2 Internal, with the addition of two pieces of functionality: A way to search the blog, and the ability to log in to an admin account, with the ability to add new posts being restricted to this account.

For this reason this content assumes either:
1. Enough relevant knowledge to implement this into an existing project, or
2. That the level 2 work has been completed prior to this.

Please note that this content will not cover styling our new additions, as that is best left up to the student to decide for themselves. *how* to style content is covered in Level 2. These implimentations will also intentionally be left somewhat incomplete, to allow for adaptation to the specific needs of individual projects, just covering the "hardest" parts of implementation, to provide a jumping off point.
