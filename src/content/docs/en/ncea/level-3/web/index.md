These guides will cover the required content for achieving the [NCEA level 3 web internal](https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/ncea-resource/achievements/2024/as91902.pdf)

These will build on the blog created for the level 2 Internal, with the addition of two pieces of functionality: A way to search the blog, and the ability to log in to an admin account, with the ability to add new posts being restricted to this account.

For this reason this content assumes either:
1. Enough relevant knowledge to implement this into an existing project, or
2. That the level 2 work has been completed prior to this.
