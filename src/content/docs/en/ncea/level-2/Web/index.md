description: Overview of Level 2 Resources

  order: 1
---

This exists as a base resource for covering NCEA Digitech at level 2 with 3 chosen Internals which is enough to pass. These resources are freely available under a Creative Commons License and provide resources for students and teachers. This is an opinionated delivery process based on our experience and supported by those who contribute to this Wiki.

The design of this resource is based on project work to teach concepts instead of pure theory with three explore projects, two design projects and the final capstone project which will be used for the internals. These resources are designed with someone with little to no programming experience required but also have escape hatches built in to cover more complex topics.

This covers these 3 internals

Internals:

- 6 credits - [Programming - AS91896](https://www.nzqa.govt.nz/nqfdocs/ncea-resource/achievements/2019/as91896.pdf)

:::note[Other Technology]
This does not mean these tools are the best nor the ony way to do it, often you will choose specific tools depending on what you are doing and these tools can change project to project. This is merely an opinionated set for use in covering these topics and these guides have many escape hatches or resources to other ways of doing it if you so choose.

## Projects

A repository of the final result of these guides can be found on our github [Here](https://github.com/Tuhura-Tech/ncea-level-2-web-tutorial) if at any point you get completely stuck, take a look at our code!

### Base Website

This project goes over the basics of HTML, CSS and FastAPI to build a basic blog.

### Databases

This adds an SQL Databse to our website, allowing us to add and display blog posts dynamically, without having to edit the file ourselves.

### Testing

Taking our existing website we extend it to add automated testing.
