We can install pytest inside our Python virtual environment using

```python
pip install -U pytest
```

We'll then want to create a new folder called "Tests"

and inside that, create a new file called 'Test_pytest.py'

:::[File names]
Pytest looks for files with names that either start with Test_ or end with _Test, so it's important that this file is named correctly
