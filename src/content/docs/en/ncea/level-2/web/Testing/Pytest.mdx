We can install pytest and requests inside our Python virtual environment using

```python
uv pip install requests pytest
```

We'll then want to create a new folder called "tests"

and inside that, create a new file called 'test_pytest.py'

:::[File names]
Pytest looks for files with names that either start with test_ or end with _test, so it's important that this file is named correctly

### Writing a simple test

Once you've created a test file, you can begin writing tests. Say you have a function in your main file called multiplyfour, that takes an input of a number, and returns it multiplied by 4.

We would test that it's actually multiplying by four like this:

```python
def test_multiply():
    assert multiplyfour(4) == 16
```

When our tests are run, we'll be told how many have passed and how many have failed, and be given specific information on the tests which failed.

### Running the tests

To run your tests, you can simply run 

```sh
pytest
```

in the terminal.


### Testing your SQL Database

Testing our SQL database using Pytest is thankfully nice and easy using fastapi and pytest.

First, we'll want to add some more imports to our test file

:::Note[naming]
We use "main" here because that's what our main python file is called, if yours is called something else, you'll have to use that name.
:::


```python
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from sqlmodel import Session, SQLModel, create_engine
import pytest
from main import app, get_session 

```

Then, we'll create a **fixture** function. This will ensure that all of our tests are using an entirely fresh database, and that the database data doesn't persist between tests, which could cause problems for certain tests.

```python
@pytest.fixture()
def test_db():
    SQLModel.metadata.create_all(engine)
    yield
    SQLModel.metadata.drop_all(engine)
```

This function will ensure that whenever we pass it as a reference to a test, that test starts with an empty db, and that the db is cleared afterward, even if the test fails.

Then, let's create a new function to see if a post is added to the database correctly.

First we create a new testing function and then a testclient, based on our app.

```python
def test_create_post():
    client = testClient(app)

```

Then, we use that testclient to invoke the function where we create a new post and pass it through some test parameters.

```python
    response = client.post(
        "/posts/", params = {"post_title": "test", "post_content": "test", "post_date": "test"}
    )
```

Then, we extra the returned data (In this case, it should be a post) and check if the data matches what we'd expect using **assert**


```python
data = response.json()
assert data["title"] == "test"
assert data["content"] == "test"
assert data["data_posted"] == "test"
assert data["id"] is not None
```


for a full test function that looks like this:

```python
def test_create_post():
    client = TestClient(app)

    response = client.post(
        "/posts/", params = {"post_title": "test", "post_content": "test", "post_date": "test"}
    )
    
    data = response.json()
    assert data["title"] == "test"
    assert data["id"] is not None
```
