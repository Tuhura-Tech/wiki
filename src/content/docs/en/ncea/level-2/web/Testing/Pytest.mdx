We can install pytest inside our Python virtual environment using

```python
uv pip install pytest
```

We'll then want to create a new folder called "tests"

and inside that, create a new file called 'test_pytest.py'

:::[File names]
Pytest looks for files with names that either start with test_ or end with _test, so it's important that this file is named correctly

### Writing a simple test

Once you've created a test file, you can begin writing tests. Say you have a function in your main file called multiplyfour, that takes an input of a number, and returns it multiplied by 4.

We would test that it's actually multiplying by four like this:

```python
def test_multiply():
    assert multiplyfour(4) == 16
```

When our tests are run, we'll be told how many have passed and how many have failed, and be given specific information on the tests which failed.

### Running the tests

To run your tests, you can simply run 

```sh
pytest
```

in the terminal.
