We have two options for setting up a development environment for web development:

1. [VSCode](#VSCode)
2. [GitHub Codespaces](#GitHub-Codespaces)

These options are not mutually exclusive, and you can use both in conjunction with each other. VSCode is a powerful code editor that can be used to write code, while GitHub Codespaces is a cloud-based development environment that can be used to run code. They both have the same capabailities however VSCode runs locally on your computer while GitHub Codespaces runs on the cloud.
