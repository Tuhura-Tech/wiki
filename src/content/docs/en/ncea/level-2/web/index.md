This exists as a base resource for covering NCEA Digitech at level 2 with 3 chosen Internals which is enough to pass. These resources are freely available under a Creative Commons License and provide resources for students and teachers. This is an opinionated delivery process based on our experience and supported by those who contribute to this Wiki.

The design of this resource is based on project work to teach concepts instead of pure theory with three explore projects, two design projects and the final capstone project which will be used for the internals. These resources are designed with someone with little to no programming experience required but also have escape hatches built in to cover more complex topics.

This covers these 3 internals

Internals:

This does not mean these tools are the best nor the ony way to do it, often you will choose specific tools depending on what you are doing and these tools can change project to project. This is merely an opinionated set for use in covering these topics and these guides have many escape hatches or resources to other ways of doing it if you so choose.
