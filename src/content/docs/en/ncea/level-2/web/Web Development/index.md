This page will walk you through setting up a basic webpage using Jinja2 templating and FastAPI

You should already have installed UV, created a project directory, CD'd into the directory, and setup a Virtual Env. If you haven't, take a look at the Development Environment pages todo: link

## Installing FastAPI/Jinja2

The first thing we'll want to do is install FastAPI so we can use it in our project, which will also install Jinja2

```sh
uv add "fastapi[standard]"
```

## Setting up directories

Let's create two folders inside our project directory, one called "static" and the other called "templates"

You can also delete **hello.py** and replace it with a new file called **main.py**

Which should leave you with a project that looks something like this:
