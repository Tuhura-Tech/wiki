## Good Practices

### Single Source of Truth

When designing a database, it is important to have a single source of truth. This means that you should avoid duplicate data. For example, if you have a table of users, you should not have a table of users and a table of admins. Instead, you should have a table of users and a column in that table that specifies whether or not the user is an admin.

-   Avoid duplicate data
-   Avoid data that can be derived from other data

As designs grow more complex, it can be difficult to maintain a single source of truth. This is why it is important to have a good design from the start. Sometimes refactoring data into a reference table can be a good solution to this problem.

## Entity Relationship Diagram

An easy way to visualize a database design is to use an entity relationship diagram (ERD). An ERD is a diagram that shows the relationships between entities in a database. An entity is a table in a database. A relationship is a connection between two entities.

### Diagrams

Drawing diagrams using tools such as [draw.io](https://draw.io) can be a good way to visualize your database design.


### Full ERD Software

As your database design grows more complex, you may want to use a full ERD software. These tools allow you to create a database design and then generate the SQL code to create the database. They also have the ability to do analysis on your database design to find potential problems.

A good example of this is [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) or [ERD-Editor](https://erd-editor.io).
