## Using shapes

Modify the two functions in your `sketch.js` file to this code here, and feel free to change around any of the code to your liking! Make sure to read the comments which explain what each line does.

```js
function setup() {
    createCanvas(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
    background('grey'); // any RGB value can go in here!
    // Search up 'color picker' on Google to find specific colours.
}

function draw() {
    noStroke(); // Taking away the default border
    fill('white'); // Filling the following shapes with a colour of your choice
    // Drawing a rectangle specifying the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, width and height
    rect(50, 50, 300, 100);

    fill('black'); // Changing the colour again
    // a text function in p5.js which lets you write on the canvas.
    textSize(32);
    text('My painting area!!', 60, 110);
}
```

## Using a Custom Function

Firstly, let's create a custom function which paints 20 circles around a certain point, for a unique paintbrush effect.
Here is what I've coded, but you are encouraged to change any of the variables and add/delete lines of code to see what happens.

> Remember: there's always undo button if you ever mess up.

```js
/**
 * The 'paintbrush' function takes two parameters, 'x' and 'y', representing the center of the brush.
 * @param x The x coordinate
 * @param y The y coordinate
 */
function paintbrush(x, y) {
    noFill(); // This line sets the brush to have no fill color for the shapes.

    stroke(random(0, 255), random(0, 255), random(0, 255), random(0, 255));
    // Here, the 'random(0, 255)' generates a random number between 0 and 255 for each component (R, G, B, A) of the color.

    // This 'for' loop will repeat the following lines of code 20 times.
    for (let i = 0; i < 20; i++) {
        
        // The circle function:
        // Its 'x' position is random within a 20-pixel range centered on 'x'.
        // Its 'y' position is random within a 20-pixel range centered on 'y'.
        // The circle's size is random between 10 and 50 pixels.
        circle(random(x - 10, x + 10), random(y - 10, y + 10), random(10, 50));
    }
}
```

As you can see, inside this function I have used other functions like `random()`, `stroke()` or `circle`, which are functions we don't have to make as they've already been made by the libraries we are using!

:::note[What is a for loop?]
The for loop repeatedly executes the line of code 20 times, controlling the iteration through an making a variable called `i`, checking if it's less than 20, and increasing `i` by 1 each loop.

## Using Prebuilt Functions
Inside the p5.js library, there are prebuilt functions! Here are two valuable functions which you can play around with:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="mousePressed">

This function only executes when your mouse is pressed, so we only need to write this:
```js
function mousePressed(){
    paintbrush(mouseX, mouseY);
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="mouseDragged">

Likewise, this function only executes when your mouse is dragging, so we only need to write this:
```js
function mouseDragged(){
    paintbrush(mouseX, mouseY);
}
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Your Ultra Paintbrush

If you have finished all three of those functions, try and see if you can make a paintbrush which only changes to certain colours. Then, make another paintbrush which uses another shape instead of `circle`. 
Finally, try and create a paintbrush which combines all three of the different paintbrushes, depending on what type of key you press (hint: search up 'keyPressed in p5.js').

Well done! You have now created a canvas with your own custom paintbrush using a JavaScript library called p5js.
