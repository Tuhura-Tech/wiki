## Intro

p5.js is a JavaScript library which implements your own canvas for creating interactive projects - the web browser is your limit...

If you want to know more about this library, the official website is <a href="https://p5js.org/get-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.
Have a look around and click on the examples on the left hand side to see what results you could end up with!

## Starting Your Project

We will be showing you how to start a project which is hosted by this p5.js library.

### 1. Follow Setting Up
Firstly, follow the JavaScript 'Setting Up' page until you have a folder with a file named `package.json`.

### 2. Create a new JS file
In the terminal (`cat > filename`) or with the right-click of your mouse, create a new file named `sketch.js`.
Inside this file, put this code:
```js
function setup() {
    createCanvas(window.innerWidth, window.innerHeight);
}

function draw() {
    background('grey'); // any RGB value can go in here!
    // Search up 'color picker' to find specific colours.
}
```
:::note[What is a function?]
A function is like a set of instructions that tells your computer what to do.
- The setup() function is the first to be called: it 'sets up' your environment, and in your case, it creates a canvas which is the size of your screen.
- The draw() function is the second to be called and it loops forever (the instructions inside this function will always be running). For now, the background is set to grey.

### 3. Create new HTML file
Now, this code doesn't work quite yet, because we need a way to see the code! The way to do this is to create another file, called `index.html`
    > HTML stands for Hyper-Text Markup Language, and is a way for browsers like Google to show your code!

Inside this file, copy and paste this code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/1.0.0/p5.js"></script>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>My First Canvas</title>
        <style>
            body {
            padding: 0;
            margin: 0;
            background-color: #1b1b1b;
            }
        </style>
        <script src="sketch.js"></script>
    </head>
</html>
```
:::note[What does this code mean?]
 - Every HTML document must start with the html tag at the start.
 - The head section contains metadata and resource links used by the web page.
 - A script tag loads the p5.js library from online resources.
 - The meta tags specify the character encoding for the document and sets the viewport for the browser.
 - The title tag sets the web page's title that appears in the browser tab.
 - Inside the style section, CSS rules define the web page's appearance.
 - Another script tag links to your JavaScript file you just created.
