## What is this Wiki for?

This Wiki is a collection of resources and guides for ākonga (students) and kura (schools) in Aotearoa. We aim to provide free and open source resources for students to learn about technology. Our resources are designed to be used by students in their own time or by teachers in the classroom. It covers introductory guides, NCEA resources and is kept up to date by our staff and all the volunteer contributors.

## About Us

At [Tūhura Tech](https://tuhuratech.org.nz), our mission is to provide free technology education to rangatahi in the Wellington region. We believe that every rangatahi should have the opportunity to learn about and engage with technology, regardless of their background or financial situation. As part of that we maintain a collection of public resources.
