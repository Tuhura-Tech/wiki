## Overview

Circuit simulation provides a way to design and observe electronic circuits **without using physical hardware**.

It allows components to be connected virtually and circuit behaviour to be examined before building real-world versions. This makes simulation especially useful for learning, experimentation, and early-stage design.

## Tinkercad Circuits

One commonly used browser-based simulation platform is <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>Tinkercad</strong></a>.


Tinkercad Circuits is an online circuit simulation environment that can be accessed through a web browser. An account can be created using an email address.

The platform provides a **visual workspace** where circuit designs are created by placing and connecting components in a three-dimensional layout.

## Available Components

Tinkercad Circuits includes a wide range of commonly used electronic components that closely correspond to real-world electronic parts discussed in the [Electronic Components](../electronic-components/)
section.

This allows learners to recognise components visually and understand how they are typically arranged and wired in real circuits.

## Why Use Circuit Simulation?

Circuit simulation allows users to:

- Visualise how components are connected  
- Observe circuit behaviour without physical risk  
- Understand how wiring and component placement affect outcomes  
- Recognise how electronic components appear and interact in real layouts  

Simulation provides an accessible way to become familiar with circuit structure and connections before working with physical hardware.

## From Simulation to Real Circuits

Circuits created in simulation can later be recreated using **real components**.

This approach supports gradual familiarisation, especially for beginners, before transitioning to:

- Breadboards  
- Microcontrollers  
- Physical electronic components  

Simulation helps build confidence and understanding before handling real hardware.
