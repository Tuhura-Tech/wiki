## Overview

The RP2040 is a microcontroller designed and produced by Raspberry Pi Ltd.

It is widely used in development boards for education, prototyping, and embedded projects.

---

## Processor Features

The RP2040 processor features:

- dual-core Arm Cortex-M0+ CPUs  
- flexible general-purpose input/output (GPIO) pins  
- support for multiple communication protocols  
- low-power operation  

Detailed technical specifications are available in the official

## GPIO Pins and Board Layout

RP2040-based development boards expose a set of **General Purpose Input/Output (GPIO)** pins.

These pins allow the microcontroller to interact with external components and circuits.

At a high level, GPIO pins are used for:
- digital input and output  
- analog input (on supported pins)  
- communication interfaces  
- power and ground connections

:::note
Pin labels and available features can vary between RP2040-based boards. Always refer to the pinout diagram for your specific board.

## Pin Categories

RP2040 pins can be grouped into the following categories:

- **Power pins** — provide 3.3 V output and ground (GND)  
- **GPIO pins** — configurable digital input and output pins  
- **Analog pins** — pins capable of analog input via the ADC  
- **Communication pins** — used for protocols such as I2C, SPI, and UART

## Typical Pin Labels

Pins on RP2040-based boards are typically labelled using a prefix that indicates the GPIO number.

For example:

- `GP0`, `GP1`, `GP2`, …  

The exact pin mapping depends on the specific development board. Always refer to the board’s reference documentation.

---

## Using Pins in CircuitPython

In CircuitPython, pins are accessed using the `board` module.

Examples:

- `board.GP15` refers to GPIO pin 15  
- `board.GP0` refers to GPIO pin 0  

Pin names and available features may vary by board. Always confirm pin capabilities using the board’s pinout diagram.

:::note
Although the RP2040 chip is the same, different development boards may expose different pins and features.
