## Overview

<a href="https://circuitpython.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>CircuitPython</strong></a> is a programming language designed for microcontrollers.
is a programming language designed for microcontrollers.

Microcontrollers (such as RP2040-based boards) do not work on their own. They require a program to tell them:

- What components to read  
- What outputs to control  
- When and how to respond  

CircuitPython allows this program to be written using Python, a language that is widely used and beginner-friendly.

## Why CircuitPython Is Used

CircuitPython is designed to make working with hardware simpler, especially for beginners.

Key characteristics:

- Code is written as plain text files  
- Changes take effect immediately when files are saved  
- No complex compilation or flashing process  
- Easy interaction with components such as LEDs, buttons, sensors, and displays  

This makes it well-suited for learning how software controls hardware.

## How CircuitPython Works

CircuitPython runs directly on the microcontroller.

- The microcontroller appears as a removable drive when connected to a computer  
- Program files are copied to this drive  
- The main program runs automatically on the board  

The computer is used only to edit files and communicate with the device.

## Tools Used in This Guide

To work with CircuitPython, the following tools are used:

- CircuitPython firmware (runs on the microcontroller)
- <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration:none;"><strong>Visual Studio Code</strong></a> (to edit code)
- the CircuitPython extension for VS Code (to communicate with the board)

Other editors can be used, but this guide standardises on this setup.

## Supported Hardware

This guide focuses on RP2040-based microcontroller boards, which are widely used for learning and prototyping.

The same concepts apply to other CircuitPython-compatible boards.

## Install the CircuitPython Extension for VS Code

To work effectively with CircuitPython in Visual Studio Code, the CircuitPython extension must be installed.

<div style="display:flex; align-items:flex-start; gap:1.5rem; margin-bottom:1rem;">
  <img src="/src/assets/electronics/step2.png" alt="VS Code Extensions tab" style="width:360px;" />
  <div>
    Click on the <strong>Extensions</strong> tab in the VS Code sidebar and search for <strong>CircuitPython</strong>.
  </div>

<div style="display:flex; align-items:flex-start; gap:1.5rem; margin-bottom:1rem;">
  <img src="/src/assets/electronics/step3.png" alt="Search for CircuitPython extension" style="width:360px;" />
  <div>
    Click <strong>Install</strong> for <strong>CircuitPython v2 by wmerkens</strong>.

  <img src="/src/assets/electronics/step4.png" alt="Install CircuitPython extension" style="width:360px;" />
  <div>
   When prompted, click <strong>Trust Workspace & Install</strong> to confirm the installation.

## Connect the Board

1. Connect the CircuitPython-compatible board to your computer using a data-capable USB cable.  
2. Once connected, the board appears as a removable drive named `CIRCUITPY`.

---

## Open the CIRCUITPY Drive

3. Open Visual Studio Code.  
4. Open the Explorer panel.  
5. Select **Open Folder…**  
6. Choose the `CIRCUITPY` drive.

When the folder is opened, the CircuitPython extension activates automatically.

The following files may be visible:

- `code.py`  
- `main.py`  
- `boot_out.txt`  

---

## Select the Serial Port

7. At the bottom of the VS Code window, select the plug icon next to **Choose a board**.  
8. From the list, select the serial port corresponding to the connected board.

Once selected, the board name appears in the status bar.

---

## Serial Monitor and REPL

9. Open the CircuitPython Serial Monitor from the terminal panel.  
10. Press `Ctrl + C` to interrupt the running program and access the REPL.

The REPL allows direct interaction with the running CircuitPython environment.

---

## Using the REPL

11. Press `Ctrl + C` again to enter the REPL.  
12. At the prompt, enter:

    ```python
    print("hello world")
    ```

13. Confirm that **hello world** is printed in the Serial Monitor.

The REPL allows direct interaction with the running CircuitPython environment.
