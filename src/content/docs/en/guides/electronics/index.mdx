## What is Binary?

Binary is a number system used by computers to represent information using only two digits: `0` and `1`.

Unlike the decimal system (base-10), which uses digits from `0` to `9`, binary is a **base-2 system**.  
Each binary digit is called a **bit**, and it can be either:

- `0` → OFF  
- `1` → ON  

This simple ON/OFF idea makes binary perfect for computers and electronic circuits.

## Why Binary Matters

Binary is the foundation of how computers and electronic devices work. It is used in:

- Digital storage and memory
- ON/OFF signals in electronics
- LEDs, sensors, and microcontrollers
- Logic gates and decision-making circuits

At the hardware level, electronic components can easily detect two states (ON or OFF), which directly map to `1` and `0`.

## Binary Place Values

Binary numbers are based on **powers of 2**.

Each position in a binary number represents a value that **doubles as you move left**.

| Binary Position | Power of 2 | Value |
|-----------------|------------|-------|
| Rightmost bit   | 2⁰         | 1     |
|                 | 2¹         | 2     |
|                 | 2²         | 4     |
|                 | 2³         | 8     |
|                 | 2⁴         | 16    |

To find the value of a binary number, add up the place values where the bit is `1`.

## Binary Counting (0 to 15)

![Binary Counter](/src/assets/electronics/Binary_counter.gif)

**Figure 1: Binary Counter**

The animation above shows how binary values increment from `0` to `15` by switching bits **ON (`1`)** and **OFF (`0`)**.

Each step increases the number by 1, just like counting in decimal — but using binary rules.



:::note
Watch how the **rightmost bit changes the fastest**.

Higher-value bits turn ON only when the lower bits reset.

This same pattern is used in:
- Binary counters
- LED displays
- Microcontroller timers
- Digital logic circuits
