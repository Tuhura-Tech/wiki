## Next Steps

You've just made your very own 3D racing game! It's now all yours to add on new features and change it to your liking!
Here's some ideas for what your next steps should be:

<Steps>
1. Showing a speedometer in your HUD.
2. Collect powerups or extra boosts as you drive along the track.
3. Have a crack at multiplayer if you're feeling up for it!
4. Make an endless track through procedural generation! [Link to the tutorial here](/game-design/proceduralgeneration/infinite3dtutorial/0-setup/)
</Steps>

Thanks for following along this far! Happy Godoting and have fun.
