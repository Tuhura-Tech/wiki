# Adding in your car

:::note[Godot Documentation]
Godot Documentation for nodes discussed in this section:
[VehicleBody3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vehiclebody3d.html#vehiclebody3d), [VehicleWheel3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vehiclewheel3d.html)
:::

Click on the '+' button to create a new scene, and name it `car.tscn`.

### The Vehicle Body
<Steps>
1. Add a child **VehicleBody3D** node.
    
    Change its **Mass** to **200kgs**.
1. Add a **MeshInstance3D** and make a **New BoxMesh**. Change this to a car shape (my Size is (1.5, 0.5, 3)).
1. On the menu bar **Mesh** button, create a collision shape. But this time,
    
    **Collision shape placement** is `Sibling`. This is because the car needs to not be static.

    **Collision Shape Type** is `Simplified Convex`.
1. To change the colour of your car, go **MeshInstance3D > Mesh > Material > New StandardMaterial3D > Albedo** and change the colour.
1. Save your scene.
</Steps>

In your main scene with the ground, drag your saved car scene into the Ground (the top) node.

### The Vehicle Wheels
<Steps>
1. Add a child **VehicleWheel3D** node to VehicleBody3D and rename it to "FrontLeftWheel".
1. Using the X, Y, Z axes adjust the wheel location to be just outside the vehicle body.
1. In the Inspector:
    - Under **VehicleBody3D Motion** tick
        - [x] **Use as Steering** (as we want the front wheels to steer).
    - Under **Wheel** change the **Roll Influence** to 1.0 (to keep the car from flipping over) **Radius** to 0.4m and **Friction Slip** to 4 (1 is normal grip, higher means more grip).
    - Under **Suspension** set **Stiffness** to 50 (or a value between 50 and 100 for a race car).
    - Under **Damping** set **Compression** to 0.5 (0.0 will make the car bounce through its' springs, we want less bounce for a race car).
1. Add a child **MeshInstance3D** node and create a **New CylinderMesh**.
    - By clicking on the mesh instance, change the Top & Bottom Radius to the same as the Wheel Radius (0.4m).
    - Change the Height to 0.3m.
    - Under the **MeshInstance3D > Tranform**, set the **Rotation z** to **90** degrees.
1. Duplicate this wheel (CTRL/CMD D). Under the Transform tab, change the **x-position** to the negation of the current number. Rename it to "FrontRightWheel".
1. Select both these wheels and duplicate again, this time changing the **z-position** to its' negation. Rename them to "BackRightWheel" and "BackLeftWheel".
1. Set the back wheels' **VehicleBody3D Motion** to tick
     - [x] **Use as Traction** (as we want the back wheels to accelerate).
</Steps>

## Checklist
<Checklist>
- [ ] I have a car body and four wheels.
- [ ] I understand how I can change the VehicleBody3D and VehicleWheel3D in the Inspector to suit my liking (e.g., if I want my wheels to be a different colour, or if I want the front wheels to accelerate too).
</Checklist>
