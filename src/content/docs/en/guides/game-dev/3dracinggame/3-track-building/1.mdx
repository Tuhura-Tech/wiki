# Adding in your barriers
So the car doesn't go off track!

<Steps>
1. ###### Making *a* barrier
    Add another **CSGPolygon3D** and do the same steps as before [to make the path barrier visible](/game-design/godot/3dracinggame/3-track-building#making-the-path-visible).
    - Then, check
        - [x] **Path Joined** and the
        - [x] **Use Collision** checkboxes.
        - **Collision Priority** to `10` (as we don't want the car to get stuck into the barrier).
2. Rename this polygon to `Invisible Barrier`, as it will be invisible soon!
3. ###### Making the invisible barrier

    We need the shape to have two rectangles following along the edges of the road.
    - To make two rectangles from this, change the size to be 8, and set the x & y coordinates like in the photo.
    - The two light-blue outlines you see in the photo should be the end result.
    - You will not see the polygon take shape until you've entered in all the corner positions.

    - Click the eye inside on the Road Barrier scene so that it isn't visible.
    - Then test it out!
5. ###### Creating your racing barrier bars

    To make this look like a racing track, there are usually good looking race track barriers instead of the blocky barrier we've just made.
    - Repeat the steps in [making *a* barrier](#making-a-barrier)
    - Rename to `Road Barrier Left`, and add in these points:
    ![track Barrier coordinates](/src/assets/godot/3DRacing/trackBarrierPositions.png)
    - CTRL/CMD D to duplicate this barrier. Rename it to `Road Barrier Right` and try to change the points to be on the opposite side.

        - Change corners 0 and 3 to have their x = -4, then corners 1 and 2 to have their x = -4.5, so it's inside the invisible barriers collision area.
        - Change corners 0 and 1 to have their y = 1.5, then change corners 2 and 3 to have their y = 1, so the barrier is off the ground (around the cars height).
        </details>
    - To customise this track, repeat the steps of adding a texture (**NewStandardMaterial3D > Albedo > Texture**), and I've added **Smooth Faces** to make the barrier look round.
6. ###### Merging the road & ground: a hill
    - Repeat the steps in [making *a* barrier](#making-a-barrier)
    - Rename to `Hill`.
    - Add the same texture as the ground. [Previous instructions here (start at step 6).](/game-design/godot/3dracinggame/0-main-scene#setting-up-the-main-scene)
    - Try to change the points to be from the bottom of the road to the top of the ground, all the way around.
        <details>
        <summary>Hint: how I did it</summary>
        - Change corner 0's x = -20, corner 1's x = -6, corner 2's x = 6, and corner 3's x = 15.
        - Change corners 0 and 3 to have their y = -10, then change corners 1 and 2 to have their y = -0.5.
        </details>
</Steps>

Test it out again!
