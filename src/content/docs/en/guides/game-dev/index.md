## What is game design?

Game design is the process of creating the rules and mechanics of a game, and usually refers to video games in particular. It is a very broad field, and can include everything from the 3D modelling optimization to coding a custom physics engine.

The term "Game Design" specifically refers to the design of the game itself, and not the art, music, or other assets that go into the game. However, it is a very undefined term, and can be used to refer to any part of the game development process.
