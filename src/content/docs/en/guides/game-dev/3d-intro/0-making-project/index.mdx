This is a guide for making a 3-dimensional game in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). If you are unfamiliar with Godot, check out the [Godot basics](/game-design/godot/basics) doc.

:::note[Version]
This guide is up-to-date with Godot 4.1.3 stable official release but will most likely work with any 4.x release.

## Making the project

Making the project is just as easy as 2D. (check back on the [2D intro] if you need help setting up again)

:::danger[New update]
As of Godot 4.3 this menu looks slightly different, it will automatically create a folder if you have the create folder tick-box checked! 
:::

Make sure your project is set to **Forward+**.

:::note[Different renderers]
In 2D, what renderer you choose has minimal effect on your final outcome due to how simple 2D images are to draw to a screen.
With 3D, there is a large disparity between the renderers.
Read the notes next to each renderer before picking something other than **Forward+**.
:::

![Create root node, 3D Scene highlighted](/src/assets/godot/3D/CreateRootNode.png)

Set the root node to 3D and your project is set up!  
Although, go ahead and save the scene with **Scene > Save Scene** so you have the scene file saved.
