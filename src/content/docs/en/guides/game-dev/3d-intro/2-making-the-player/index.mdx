First, you're going to want to set up a platform for the player to stand on.

<Steps>
1. Add a **StaticBody3D** as a child of **Node3D**.
2. Add **MeshInstance3D** and **CollisionShape3D** as a child of **StaticBody2D**.
3. In the inspector on the right side of the screen, set **MeshInstance3D**'s 'Mesh' property to **New PlaneMesh**. Set the **CollisionShape3D**'s 'Shape' property to **New BoxShape3D**.
4. Select **CollisionShape3D** in the scene tree and use the orange dots to shape the **BoxShape3D** to the same shape and size as the plane.
5. As a child of **Node3D**, add **CharacterBody3D**.
6. Add as a child of **CharacterBody3D** add **Camera3D** and **CollisionShape3D**.
7. Set the collision shape to capsule.
8. Select the **CharacterBody3D** and move it up in the viewport until it's on top of the plane.
9. Move the camera up so it's where the 'head' should be on the character.
10. Give the **CharacterBody3D** a script and leave it as the default template script.
11. One final step, add a **DirectionalLight3D** as a child of **Node3D** and rotate it to point down, this can be anywhere in the scene.
</Steps>

Phew! That was some setup, your scene should look something like this:

Now when you play the game and press **down** on the arrow keys you should move backwards off the platform and fall off, you should see the platform briefly as you fall.
