Let's get our enemies spawning on their own, we wouldn't have much of a game if we had to add every enemy manually!

As you may have come to expect by now, we'll be making a new scene, again with a Node3D root. Although in this case, that'll be it! We don't need our spawner to do anything other than exist in 3D Space with a script.
If you want your spawners to be visible, feel free to add a **MeshInstance3D** but mine will be invisible. Save the scene, call it 'spawner_scene'

Let's get straight into the scripting! Attach it to the Node3D in your new scene, call it 'spawner_script'

<Steps>

1. Let's again have a think about what we're going to need:
	1. A reference to the enemy Scene so we can create copies of it
	2. Some way to control how often enemies are spawned
	3. To actually spawn the enemy

	Nothing too complicated! But definitely some new concepts. We'll tackle them one at a time!

2. As always, let's start by declaring some variables.

	```gdscript
	@export var spawn_delay_lower = 2
	@export var spawn_delay_upper = 4
	@export var enemy_scene:PackedScene
	var ready_to_spawn = true
	```

	We won't be doing anything in the **_ready()** function so you can either delete it or just leave it.

	Our first two exported variables here will be used to control the spawnrate of our enemies, while allowing for some randomness.
	Our second export will be our reference to our enemy. When we declare a variable in Godot, we can add ':'' followed by a variable type to allow only that type. This is especially useful for exports. (If not declaring a default value, exports require a type to be given)

	**ready_to_spawn** is simply to keep track of if we're ready to spawn another enemy yet.

3. Let's get straight into the **_process** function!

	First things first, let's check if we're ready to spawn another enemy.
	```gdscript
	if(ready_to_spawn):
			ready_to_spawn = false
		var rng = RandomNumberGenerator.new()
	```

	simple enough, if we are ready to spawn, indicate that we're not ready to spawn, and go onto our spawning logic.
	We'll also create a new RandomNumberGenerator so that we can generate a random number within our defined range.

4. Next, we'll need to create a **Timer** and create our very own **Signal** that calls a function when the timer ends. Sounds scary, but I promise it's not!

	First, let's make that **Timer**

	```gdscript
	var t = get_tree().create_timer(rng.randi_range(spawn_delay_lower, spawn_delay_upper))
	```
	This will create a timer, add it to the scene tree (*Everything* needs to be in the tree) and give it a timer with a length between our lower and upper **spawn_delay**

5. Now, let's connect it to a function.

	```gdscript
	t.timeout.connect(spawnEnemy)
	```
	You've made your very own signal like the one we used earlier! This connects our as of yet uncreated function called 'spawnenemy' when the timer ends. 

6. Giving us a process function that looks like this:

	```gdscript
	func _process(delta):
		if(ready_to_spawn):
			ready_to_spawn = false
		var rng = RandomNumberGenerator.new()
			var t = get_tree().create_timer(rng.randi_range(spawn_delay_lower, spawn_delay_upper))
			t.timeout.connect(spawnEnemy)
	```

7. Let's make that function, where our actual spawning logic will sit.

	First, we need to instantiate (create) an instance of our enemy scene

	```gdscript
	func spawnEnemy():
		var n = enemy_scene.instantiate()
	add_child(n)
	```
	We create a copy of the node, and importantly, add it to the scene.

8. Then, let's set its position, and then flag that we're ready to create a new enemy

	```gdscript
	n.global_position = global_position
	ready_to_spawn = true
	```

9. giving us a function that looks like this:

	```gdscript
	func spawnEnemy():
		var n = enemy_scene.instantiate()
		add_child(n)
		n.global_position = global_position
		ready_to_spawn = true
	```

</Steps>

Our script is done, but there are a couple more important things we need to do before it's ready to test.
<Steps>
1. Make sure you open the spawner scene and in the inspector drag your enemy scene into the 'enemy_scene' field.
2. Move your spawner from the scene origin to somewhere else in the scene, so that it doesn't spawn things on top of the objective.
</Steps>
After those steps, we should be good to test! Run your game, and let a few enemies spawn. 

Congratulations! Your game now has continuously spawning enemies! Now to destroy them! 


#### Some things to try
1. Trying messing with the spawn timer variables until you're happy with their rate of spawning.
2. Add a few more spawners to your scene, so that enemies spawn from multiple different locations
3. If you created a second type of enemy, create spawners that create that enemy with a different spawn delay *Remember:* You don't need to make a new script, all you need to do is change the scene inside the 'enemy_scene' field!
