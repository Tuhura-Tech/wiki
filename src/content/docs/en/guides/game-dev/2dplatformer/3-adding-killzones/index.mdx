## Adding Killzones

Next let's make a killzone so that when you fall off the map or hit an enemy, you'll restart the level.

<Steps>

1. Create a new scene with an Area2D node and rename it Killzone. Go to Collision in the Inspector and change the mask to only have 2 selected. 

2. Attach a script to Killzone. Default options are ok.

3. Click on Killzone and in the node menu on the right connect the “body_entered” signal to the Killzone script. Replace the all of the code in the script with this:
	```gdscript
	extends Area2D
	## Kill area, reloads the game


	# Restart the game when the engine is free to do so
	func _on_body_entered(body:Node2D):
		get_tree().call_deferred("reload_current_scene")

	```

4. After saving, you can now drag this scene into your Level1 scene. 

5. Give the Killzone a CollisionShape2D as a child node in the Level1 scene and rename it to Collider. Make the shape a New WorldBoundaryShape2D. Drag this below your platforms so the player can fall into it. ![Screenshot showing WorldBoundary](/src/assets/godot/2DPlatformer/screenshot10.png)

	You don't need to stretch it out as it will automatically cover the bottom of the scene.
