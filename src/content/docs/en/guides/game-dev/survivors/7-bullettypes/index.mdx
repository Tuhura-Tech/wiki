Now that we've made something we can check if the player has met the requirements to get a new bullet type, we can talk about making the different bullet types.

Inheritance is a core foundational programming concept. We'll be using it to make two, or potentially more, bullet types.

:::note[What is inheritance]

Inheritance is like taking the blueprint of one object and using it as the blueprint for another object, but with the new object's additions. If you change the original object's blueprint it also changes the blueprint for the new object. But, if you change the new object it doesn't change the original blueprint, just adds onto the blueprint for itself.

You've already been using inheritance. Your player and enemy classes have been using the **CharacterBody2D** class as its original blueprint. The function you've been using, `move_and_slide`, comes from the **CharacterBody2D** class.

And **CharacterBody2D** extends **PhysicsBody2D**, which extends **CollisionObject2D**, and so on. Here's the full line of inheritance that leads to `move_and_slide` as shown in **Search Help**:

We'll be using it by extending the bullet class and to make inherited scenes.

For this guide we'll have a speed bullet and a piercing bullet. One will move fast, the other will move slower but go through enemies and destroy multiple.

#### Inherited Scenes
<Steps>
1. In the **FileSystem** dock, find your bullet scene, right-click it and select **New Inherited Scene**. The new scene in your editor should look identical, but all child node names will be yellow. This just means any changes to the original scene will copy over to these.

    In the future if we want to update all bullets, for example by giving them an **AnimatedSprite2D** instead of just a **Sprite2D**, then we would only need to change the bullet scene instead of every scene.

2. Save this scene as `speed_bullet.tscn`.

3. Make another inherited scene based on the original bullet scene. Save this new scene as `piercing_bullet.tscn`.

    Both types of bullet will inherit from the base bullet scene/class.

4. On the root **Area2D** node you will need to disconnect the current script and add new ones.

</Steps>

#### Extending Bullet

First, we'll need to change how the original bullet script works to be ready for inheritance.

##### Original Bullet Class

<Steps>
1. If you haven't already, give the original bullet script a class name of `Bullet`.

    Your function that's connected to the `body_entered` signal of **Area2D** starts by checking if the body that entered is an enemy. Every bullet is going to be doing that, so we don't want to rewrite that every time when we overwrite the function.

2. Instead, we should just make a bare-bones function that will be the default if the extending class doesn't overwrite it:

    ```gdscript
    func _on_body_entered(body):
        if body is Enemy:
            enemy_entered(body)


    func enemy_entered(enemy: Enemy) -> void:
        enemy.queue_free()
    ```

3. Also, while we're here change the `SPEED` constant to `@export var speed`. `@export` means it shows up in the inspector, and we change it from CONSTANT_CASE to snake_case because it's no longer a constant. You'll also have to change it in `_physics_process`. This just lets us change the speed of each bullet without having to overwrite more things in the script.
</Steps>
##### Speed Bullet
<Steps>
1. In your speed bullet scene replace the script with a new script and give it this:

    ```gdscript
    class_name SpeedBullet extends Bullet


    func enemy_entered(enemy: Enemy) -> void:
        enemy.queue_free()
        queue_free()
    ```

    It's a very small script, and you might be wondering how it'll move and do all the other things a bullet needs to do. Well, all of that is already in the **Bullet** class that you've written previously. Now, we're just adding onto that and replacing `enemy_entered` with new contents.

2. Since it's a speed bullet, in the **Inspector** dock, increase the speed on the **Area2D** node. Well, now it's a **SpeedBullet** node, and you're changing the **Bullet** node variable.
</Steps>
##### Piercing Bullet

Do all the same for piercing bullet, but remove the final `queue_free()`, change the class name to **PiercingBullet** and decrease the speed.

#### Choosing Which to Spawn

In your projectile spawner script, add the two new bullet scenes as global variables. Then, replace `var new_projectile: Bullet = BULLET.instantiate()` (or equivalent) with:

```gdscript
var new_projectile: Bullet
if Singleton.score < 10:
	new_projectile = BULLET.instantiate()
elif Input.is_action_pressed("ui_accept"):
	new_projectile = SPEED_BULLET.instantiate()
else:
	new_projectile = PIERCING_BULLET.instantiate()
```

This is just a temporary check to see if the player has unlocked the upgraded bullets. If the player has got less than 10 score it's just the base bullet. If it's above 10 then they can use either the speed or piercing bullet by holding down spacebar or not.

You should come up with some system of your own, perhaps a shop, that decides which bullet is being used currently.
