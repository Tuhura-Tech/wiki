## Connecting HTML to CSS

In your website folder, create a new file and name it `style.css`.

At the top of your HTML document, add:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
```

Now your HTML document will read the css stylesheet and render elements as they are specified in `style.css`.

`rel` and `href` are attributes.

Attributes define the behaviour of elements in html.

As you get further into the guide, you will learn about more attributes in different types of html elements.

## Writing in CSS

Inside the css file, you can apply styles to elements that exist on the html page. It's better if you look at an example:

```css
h1{
    color: blue;
}
p{
    color: red;
}
```

In this example, we have selected all elements with the h1 tag and set their colour to blue. We have also selected all elements with the p tag and set their colour to red.

- `{}`, or curly braces, group properties together. You type them next to the tag to say "I want to make these changes to this type of element."

- `color` is an attribute, which will change the color of the text in this example.

- `:`, or colon, separates the attribute and the property.

- `blue` and `red` are properties, which correspond to colors.

- `;`, or semicolon, is used at the end of a line.

Different attributes have different kinds of properties- you wouldn't put the same values into font-size (Which takes numerical values) and font-color (Which takes colours).


:::tip[Isn't it spelled 'colour'?]
When writing in CSS, make sure to spell the color keyword without a u. Even though we don't spell it that way in Aotearoa, the machine won't recognize it because CSS primarily uses American English spelling conventions.

Let's move the image to the center of the screen using CSS, and we'll make it a little smaller while we're at it.

```css
img{
    display: block;
    margin: auto;
    width: 20%;
}
```

`display` defines the display behaviour of an element. Using `block` as the value means that this element starts on its own line and occupies the full width of the available space.

`margin` defines the amount of empty space around the element on the page. `auto` puts an equal amount of empty space on both sides of the element, so it'll sit in the center.

Pixel values such as `25px`, `300px` can be used to define the amount of empty space around the element in pixels.

`width` defines an element's width. Values can be percentages or pixel values. Experiment with different values to see how it affects the image.

## Text

Next, we will move the text to the center of the page and change the font size.

Add this property to both `h1` and `p` in your CSS file:
```css
text-align: center;
```
and this property to both your `h1` and `p` elements, with varying sizes (Your `h1` element should be larger than your `p` element):
```css
font-size: 60px;
```
