## Divs

One of the most versatile tools in web development is the `<div>` element.

The `<div>` element groups HTML elements together. It takes all the width of its parent element and creates empty space before and after itself.

Here is an example of a div.
```html
<body>
    <p>This paragraph is not inside a div.</p>
    <div> 
      <p>This paragraph is inside a div.</p>
    </div>
    <p> This paragraph is not inside a div.</p>
</body>
```


By itself, a div is unremarkable. With IDs, classes, and CSS, divs are powerful.

## id Attribute

An id is used to access individual HTML elements in your CSS file.

On a single page, each id must be unique. You can’t have multiple elements with the same id.

To give an element an id in html, you use the id attribute. 

```html
<div id="mydiv"> </div>
```

When you give an element an ID you can access it in css by using #. 

```css
#mydiv {
/* Some style */
}
```

id’s are helpful when you have multiple elements of the same type, but you want to give them different styles. 


:::note[Challenge]
Create 2 paragraphs in your HTML document and give both of them unique id’s. Apply styles to both paragraphs separately by accessing their ids in your CSS file.

## class Attribute
A class is similar to id's, however multiple elements may have the same class.

The same element may also have multiple classes!

To give an element a class in html, you use the class attribute. 

```html
<div class="myclass"> </div>
```

When you give an element a class you can access all elements of the class in css by using `.`
```css
.myclass {
  /* Some style */
}
```


Classes are helpful when you have multiple elements that you want to apply the same style to.

You can use classes and ids together. This is helpful if you have multiple elements of the same class but still want to apply different styles to them.

:::note[Summary]
- divs can be used as a container for other elements.
- Classes and ids can be used to reference specific elements in our CSS document.
