To use CSS to its full potential, you need to reorganize the HTML document first.

Try reorganize your html document so that it looks like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel=”stylesheet” href=”style.css”>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1>My first header</h1>
        <p> Hello, world!</p>
        <img src=”image.jpg” alt=”A landscape photograph of Wanaka’s lonely willow tree, taken as the sun sets.”>
    </body>
</html>
```
This is how the vast majority of html pages are formatted. These conventions are used for good reason. 

The DOCTYPE declaration and `html` element ensures the file renders properly on all browsers.

The `head` element contains metadata about the document, including the stylesheet link. This is where you would define the page title, import files, and write scripts.

The `body` element includes the content to be displayed on the page.

With these elements, we can reference them in our stylesheet. If you want to make style changes to the whole page, you could reference the `body` element.

## Comments
Comments are a way of writing notes in a source file without affecting the output.

In HTML, a comment is denoted by `<!--` and `-->`. They can take up 1 or more lines, and as long as the comment is within the two comment tags it will not be rendered.
```html
<!-- This is an HTML comment. Anything between these dashes is not rendered by the browser.
Comments are very helpful for organising your content. Add comments! -->
```

In CSS, a comment is denoted by `/*` and `*/`. They can also take up 1 or more lines
```css
/* This is a CSS comment. You can read this, but the computer won't! */
```

## Indentation
Indents are the blank space in our code at the beginning of lines. 

We use it in both HTML and CSS.

It doesn’t change how your web page looks, but it does make your code much easier to read and understand.

Indentation helps you (and others) quickly see which elements are inside other elements — this is called *nesting*. For example, anything inside the `<body>` tag should be indented one level further than the `<body>` tag itself.

You can indent by pressing the <kbd>tab</kbd> key, and you can remove an indent by pressing <kbd>shift + tab</kbd>.

Take the standard layout we made earlier:
```html
<!DOCTYPE HTML>
<html>
    <head>
        <link rel=”stylesheet” href=”style.css”>
    </head>

    <body>
        <h1>My first header</h1>
        <p> Hello, world!</p>
        <img src=”image.jpg” alt=”A landscape photograph of Wanaka’s lonely willow tree, taken as the sun sets.”>
    </body>
</html>
```

Notice how every time we open a new element inside another, like `<head>` inside `<html>` we add one more level of indentation.

Here's another example of proper indentation:
```html
<body>
    <div>
        <p>This paragraph is inside a div.</p>
    </div>
</body>
```
Without indentation, this is harder to follow.
```html
<body>
<div>
<p>This paragraph is inside a div.</p>
</div>
</body>
```


Consistent indentation will make your code more readable, and save you plenty of confusion.
