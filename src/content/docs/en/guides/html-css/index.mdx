>HTML and CSS are the core of website development. They are simple and easy to learn languages.

## HTML
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.

It is the standard markup language used to create web pages on the internet.

HTML documents include elements. These elements can be many things such as titles, paragraph text, and images. There are often elements inside of other elements. 

## CSS
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used for changing the style of a document written in a markup language. 

CSS can specify fonts, color, borders, page layout, and many other things!
## Getting Started

To get started, make a folder on your computer for your first website. Inside it, create a file and name it `index.html`.

To start writing in html, you can edit this file in any text editor of your choice. 

:::note[Text Editors]
There are many text editor programs, but you don’t need anything fancy to get started with HTML. You can use whatever you're comfortable with.

If you've coded before, you may feel more comfortable using an IDE. We recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as it comes with many helpful features for HTML development out of the box.
:::

Open `index.html` in your browser. Whenever you edit the text file, you can save your changes and refresh the browser tab to see them.

Note that this html file is local- meaning people on the internet can't see this website. It's only available on your computer.
