Forms are how users talk to your app! They type their name, pick their favorite color, or send you a message. In React, we make forms extra smart by connecting them to state.

## Controlled components

A "controlled" input is like a puppet — React controls what it shows! Every time someone types, React updates the state, and the input shows what's in the state. This means React is always the boss!

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'

function ContactForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('')

  return (
    <form onSubmit={(e) => { e.preventDefault(); alert(name); }}>
      <label>
        Name
        <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />
      </label>
      <button type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

**Output (initial):**

<form>
  <label>
    Name
    <input value="" />
  </label>
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>

**Output (after typing "Alex"):**

<form>
  <label>
    Name
    <input value="Alex" />
  </label>
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>

**When submitted, shows alert:** "Alex"

## Simple validation

Validation is like a guard that checks if everything is okay before sending! You can check if a name is too short, if an email looks right, or if a password is strong enough.

```jsx
function validateName(n) { 
  return n.trim().length > 1 
}

function SmartForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('')
  const [error, setError] = useState('')
  
  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault()
    if (validateName(name)) {
      alert(`Welcome, ${name}!`)
    } else {
      setError('Name must be at least 2 characters!')
    }
  }
  
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />
      {error && <p style={{ color: 'red' }}>{error}</p>}
      <button type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

**Output (with error):**

<form>
  <input value="A" />
  <p style="color: red;">Name must be at least 2 characters!</p>
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>

For bigger, fancier forms consider libraries like `react-hook-form` — they make forms super easy!

:::tip[Closing tags]
In JSX remember to close empty elements (for example `<input />`). Unclosed tags will usually cause an error.

:::note[Build something cool!]
Create a mini contact form with a name input. Add a paragraph that tells users what to do, and another that appears when they type something too short (like "Name must be longer!"). Make it colorful with some CSS!
