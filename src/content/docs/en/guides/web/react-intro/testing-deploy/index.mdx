You've built something cool — now let's make sure it works perfectly and share it with the world!

## Testing with Jest + React Testing Library

Testing is like having a robot check your homework! You write tests that automatically verify your components work correctly. If something breaks later, the tests will catch it. Pretty smart, right?

First, install the testing tools:

```bash
pnpm add -D jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event
# or npm install --save-dev ...
```

Here's a simple test that checks if your app shows a heading:

```jsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import App from './App'

test('renders heading', () => {
  render(<App />)
  expect(screen.getByRole('heading')).toBeInTheDocument()
})
```

**Test Output (if App has a heading):**
```
✓ renders heading (2ms)
```

**Test Output (if App has no heading):**
```
✗ renders heading

    expect(element).toBeInTheDocument()

    Received element is not present in the container
```

## Build & Deploy

Time to show your app to the world! First, you need to build it (turn it into super-fast files):

```bash
npm run build
# or pnpm run build
```

This creates a `dist` folder with all your app's files, optimized and ready to go!

### Where to deploy (it's free!)

- **Vercel**: Super easy! Just connect your GitHub and it deploys automatically.
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop your `dist` folder — boom, it's live!
- **GitHub Pages**: Host it right from your GitHub repo.

All of these are free for small projects, and they give you a real URL like `myapp.vercel.app` that you can share with friends! How cool is that?

:::tip[Closing tags]
Always close tags in JSX (for example `<img />`). Missing closing tags often cause build failures.

:::note[Play detective!]
Create a component with two paragraphs, then write a test to check if they both show up. Run the test and watch it pass—it's like having a robot verify your work! Pretty cool, huh?
