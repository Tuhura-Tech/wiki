Sometimes you need to reach into the page and touch an element directly — for example to focus an input. `useRef` is a safe way to hold a link to a DOM node or keep a value that doesn't cause a re-render.

## Focus an input with useRef

```jsx
import { useRef } from 'react'

function FocusInput() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null)

  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={inputRef} placeholder="Type here" />
      <button onClick={() => inputRef.current && inputRef.current.focus()}>
        Focus the input
      </button>
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Output (initial):**

<div>
  <input placeholder="Type here" />
  <button>Focus the input</button>
</div>

When the button is clicked the cursor moves into the input — handy when building forms or games.

## Keep mutable values without re-rendering

You can also keep a value that changes but shouldn't cause the UI to update (like a timer id).

```jsx
function Timer() {
  const countRef = useRef(0)
  function tick() { countRef.current += 1 }
  // this does not re-render — use state when you want to show values
}
```

:::tip[When to use useRef]
Use `useRef` for DOM access or storing mutable values that do not affect rendering. For visible values, prefer `useState`.

:::note[Try this]
Add the `FocusInput` component to your app and press the button — the input should receive focus. Try this on the keyboard: press Tab to move focus, then use the button to jump back.
