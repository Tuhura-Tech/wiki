Bugs happen — that's okay. Learning how to find them quickly makes you a better developer. The browser DevTools and simple logging are your friends.

## Use console.log wisely

```jsx
function ShowThings() {
  const x = 5
  console.log('value of x', x)
  return <p>Look at the console</p>
}
```

## Inspect elements and state

Open DevTools (F12) to inspect elements, view network requests, and check for errors in the Console tab.

## React DevTools

Install the React DevTools extension to inspect component trees and props — it helps you see which components rendered and why.

:::note[Tip]
If something doesn't render, check the Console for errors and ensure components are exported and imported correctly.

:::note[Try this]
Open DevTools, cause a deliberate error (for learning) and read the stack trace. Then fix the code and watch the error disappear.
