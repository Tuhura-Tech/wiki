Imagine your app is like a house with many rooms — routing lets you move between rooms without leaving the house! With React Router, you can have a Home page, an About page, a Games page, and more. When you click a link, only the content changes, not the whole page. It's super fast!

## React Router basics

First, install React Router in your React app:

```bash
pnpm add react-router-dom
# or: npm install react-router-dom
```

Now you can create different pages! Here's a simple example:

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom'
import Home from './Home'
import About from './About'

export default function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <nav>
        <Link to="/">Home</Link>
        <Link to="/about">About</Link>
      </nav>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  )
}
```

**Visual preview (when on Home page):**

<nav>
  <a href="/">Home</a>
  <a href="/about">About</a>
</nav>
<div>Home Page Content</div>

**Visual preview (when on About page):**

<nav>
  <a href="/">Home</a>
  <a href="/about">About</a>
</nav>
<div>About Page Content</div>

### Interactive demo (try it!)

import InteractiveNav from './InteractiveNav.jsx'

<InteractiveNav client:load />

:::tip[Closing tags]
Remember to always close tags in JSX — missing closing tags often cause compile-time errors. Self-close empty elements like ` <img /> ` or ` <input /> `.
:::

Notes:
- Use nested routes for layouts and shared UI.
- For server-rendered setups or when using frameworks, consult their routing guides.

:::note[Remember]
Routes define what component to show for each URL path. Links change the URL and render the matching route.
:::

:::note[Make it dynamic!]
Set up React Router with two pages—Home and Contact. Add links to jump between them, then click around and watch the URL change *without* a full page reload. Feels like magic, right?
