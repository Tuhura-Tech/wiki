Hey coder, get ready for JSX, it's like a superpower that lets you mix HTML and JavaScript in a fun way! JSX looks just like HTML, but it's actually JavaScript under the hood. Your browser needs a little help to understand it, so build tools like Vite turn it into regular JavaScript.

## A simple JSX example

Check out this cool greeting component:

```jsx
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>;
}

export default function App() {
  return <Greeting name="Tuhura" />;
}
```

**Output:**

<h1>Hello, Tuhura!</h1>

## Embedding expressions

The magic of JSX is that you can put JavaScript inside curly braces `{}`. It's like a secret portal that lets you drop any JavaScript code right into your HTML!

```jsx
const count = 3;
return <p>You have {count} new messages.</p>;
```

**Output:**

<p>You have 3 new messages.</p>

### More fun with expressions!

You can do math, call functions, and even combine conditions!

```jsx
function App() {
  const score = 95;
  const grade = score >= 90 ? 'A' : 'B';
  
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Your score: {score}</p>
      <p>Grade: {grade}</p>
      <p>Double score: {score * 2}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Output:**

<div>
  <p>Your score: 95</p>
  <p>Grade: A</p>
  <p>Double score: 190</p>
</div>

## Rendering your app

This is how React connects your components to the page:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App'

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<App />)
```

This tells React to take your App component and display it in the HTML element with id "root". Easy peasy!

:::tip[Closing tags]
Remember: JSX requires closed tags. Self-close empty elements (for example `<br />`). Missing closing tags will usually cause compile errors.

:::note[Experiment time!]
Try mixing JavaScript into your JSX! Make two paragraphs in `App`:

1. In the first, show a variable (maybe `const favoriteNumber = 42`), then display it with `{favoriteNumber}`.
2. In the second, try some fun math like `{5 * 8}` or text tricks like `{"react".toUpperCase()}`.

Save and watch your browser update—JavaScript inside HTML, how cool is that?!
