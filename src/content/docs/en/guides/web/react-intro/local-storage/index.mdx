You can save small bits of information in the browser so your app "remembers" things after a refresh. This is great for keeping a player's name, theme choice, or last-level reached.

## Save a name in localStorage

```jsx
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

function SaveName() {
  const [name, setName] = useState(() => {
    return window.localStorage.getItem('name') || ''
  })

  useEffect(() => {
    window.localStorage.setItem('name', name)
  }, [name])

  return (
    <div>
      <input value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} placeholder="Your name" />
      <p>Saved name: {name}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Output (after typing):**

<div>
  <input value="Alex" placeholder="Your name" />
  <p>Saved name: Alex</p>
</div>

Note: data stored in `localStorage` stays until cleared or removed by your code.

:::note[Try this]
Add `SaveName` to your app, type a name, then reload the page — the name should still be there.
