Accessibility means making your app usable by as many people as possible. Small changes help a lot: proper labels, keyboard support, and readable colors.

## Use semantic HTML and labels

Always use the correct HTML elements and label your inputs.

```jsx
function LabeledInput() {
  return (
    <label>
      Your name
      <input aria-label="Your name" />
    </label>
  )
}
```

**Why it matters:** screen readers and keyboard users rely on correct labels to understand the page.

## Keyboard navigation

Make sure interactive elements are reachable with Tab and that custom controls handle keyboard events.

## Color and contrast

Ensure text is readable against background colors. Prefer high-contrast color pairs for important UI.

:::tip[Quick checklist]
- Add `alt` text for images
- Use `aria-label` or `<label>` for inputs
- Ensure focus order is logical (Tab key)
- Check color contrast for text

:::note[Try this]
Inspect a page with only your keyboard: can you reach all buttons and inputs using Tab? If not, fix the order or use native elements instead of divs for controls.
