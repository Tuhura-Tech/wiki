CSS grid is one of the best tools for making a dynamic website layout.

CSS grid is used to organize HTML elements into rows AND columns. It is similar to flexbox, but in 2 dimensions instead of 1. 

The red lines represent columns and the blue lines represent rows.

We can use a div as a container, and add the elements we want to organize into a grid inside of it.

```html
<div id="gridContainer">
    <p class="gridItem" id="p1">1</p>
    <p class="gridItem" id="p2">2</p>
    <p class="gridItem" id="p3">3</p>
    <p class="gridItem" id="p4">4</p>
    <p class="gridItem" id="p5">5</p>
</div>
```

In CSS, you can set the `display` property of the container to `grid`.

`grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows` are used to define the number of columns and number of rows.

```css
/* Style for the container */
#gridContainer {
    display: grid;

    /* Defines 2 columns and 4 rows with automatically adjusting width*/
    grid-template-columns: auto auto;
    grid-template-rows: auto auto auto auto;

    /* Center container in the screen */
    width: 50%;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;

    /* Define the gap between grid elements */
    column-gap: 5px; 
    row-gap: 5px;

    /* Style for grid items */
    .gridItem {
        background-color: #6aa469;
        border-style: solid;
        border-color: white;
        width: auto;
        margin: 4px;
        text-align: center;
        font-size: 65px;
        color: white;
    }
}
```

The auto value is the width of each column/row; you can also use % or px values to define the width. 

Auto is a good choice here because it means the size of each grid cell is dynamic and adjusts to whatever text you put in it.

Now, each paragraph element should take up 1 spot each in the grid. However, an element can also take up more than 1 grid cell.

Below gridItem in your stylesheet, use #p5 to access the fifth paragraph and add the grid-column property.

```css
#p5 {
    grid-column: 1 / span 2;
}
```

In the `grid-column` property, the 1 defines the start column of this element and the `span 2` defines how many columns the element should take up. 

This allows the 5th element to take up 2 spaces in the grid, resulting in this layout:

When you use CSS grid effectively, you can use it to organize the layout of the entire website. You may even have grids inside of grids.
