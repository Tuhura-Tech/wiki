In your browser, you can open dev tools by pressing either <kbd>F12</kbd> or <kbd>right click</kbd> < <kbd>inspect</kbd>.
 
Dev tools allows you to edit pages on the fly, view how your stylesheet attributes affect the page, view debug logs, and view pages from different device aspect ratios.

And *much* more.
