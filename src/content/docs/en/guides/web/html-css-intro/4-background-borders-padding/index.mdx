## Backgrounds

This changes the background colour of the whole document.
```css
body {
    background-color: black;
}
```

The `background-color` property can be applied to any type of element, not just the body.

You can also use images as a background with the `background-image` property:

```css
body {
    background-image: url("bg_image.jpg");
    background-size: cover;
}
```

The `background-size` property ensures the image takes up the whole width of the element. You can also use percentage values, pixel values, and the `auto` or `contain` keywords as values.

## Borders
This gives an element a border.
```css
img { /* You can apply these styles to any element, not just img! */
    border-style: solid;
    border-width: 4px;
    border-color: blue;
    border-radius: 5px;
}
```

border-radius is used to make rounded borders. The higher the pixel value the more rounded it is.

You can also define different properties for different sides of the border by stringing multiple values together, like this:
```css
border-style: solid dashed dotted double;
```

In the case of borders, you can string up to 4 values in a row (Since an element has 4 sides). If there is only 1 value applied then all 4 sides will use that style.

## Padding

The `padding` property adds a gap between the element and it's border.
```css
img {
    padding: 20px;
}
```

Again, you can add different padding to different sides of an element by stringing multiple values together.
```css
img {
    padding: 20px 10px 10px 20px;
}
```

`padding` is a very versatile property and helpful in many different situations. It adds blank space around an element.
