## What is Flask?

> The Python micro framework for building web applications.

[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) is a Python framework for building web applications. It is lightweight and modular, and is a great tool for building simple websites. In this guide, we will build a simple website using Flask.

## Knowledge Required

Basic familiarity with Python, HTML/CSS and SQL will be needed to build this website and resources can be found here:

- [Python](/python/)
- [HTML/CSS](/web/)
- [SQL](/sql/)

## Getting Started

### Installing flask

To install Flask, you can use [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/), which is the package manager for Python. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install Flask
```

### Basic Flask App

Flask applications are relatively simple to create. Here is a basic Flask app that displays "Hello, World!" on the webpage:

```py
// app.py
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

To run the Flask app, save the code in a file called `app.py` and run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
$ flask run
 * Debug mode: off
WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment. Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
Press CTRL+C to quit
```

:::tip
We can run Flask in debug mode to automatically reload the server when changes are made to the code. To run the app in debug mode, use the command `flask run --debug`.
:::

This will start a development server on your local machine, and you can access the website by visiting [http://127.0.0.1:5000](http://127.0.0.1:5000) in your browser. You should see the text "Hello, World!" displayed on the webpage.

#### So how does this work?

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>

1. Import the `Flask` class from the `flask` module.

   ```py
   from flask import Flask;
   ```

   This imports the Flask class from the Flask module, which is used to create a Flask application.

2. Create the Flask app.

   ```py
   app = Flask(__name__)
   ```

   This creates a new Flask application instance. The `__name__` argument is a special Python variable that is set to the name of the current module. This is used by Flask to determine the root path of the application.

3. Define a route.

   ```py
   @app.route('/')
   ```

   Flask uses things called decorators `@app.route('/')` to map functions to different webpages (routes). In this case, we are mapping the `index` function to the root URL `/`. 
   
4. Define the `index` function.

   ```py
   def hello():
       return 'Hello, World!'
   ```

   When a user visits the root URL, the `hello` function is called, and it returns the text `Hello, World!`. For more complex applications, you can return HTML or JSON data.
