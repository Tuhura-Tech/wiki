While blueprints are good for organising the code things will start to get messy as the app grows. We can use python modules to create a more organised structure.

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<FileTree>

- flaskapp/
  - static/
    - style.css
  - templates/
    - index.html
    - base.html
  - `__init__.py`
  - blog.py
  - db.py

</FileTree>

:::tip
Most Python projects use this structure to organise their code and should be used as for all your projects.

## Creating the app

Create a new folder called `flaskapp` and add a `__init__.py` file to it. This file will be the entry point for the app.

```python
// flaskapp/__init__.py
from flask import Flask
import contextlib
import os

def create_app(test_config=None) -> Flask:
    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config.from_mapping(
        SECRET_KEY="dev",
        DATABASE=os.path.join(app.instance_path, "flaskapp.sqlite"),
    )

    if test_config is None:
        # load the instance config, if it exists, when not testing
        app.config.from_pyfile("config.py", silent=True)
    else:
        # load the test config if passed in
        app.config.from_mapping(test_config)

    # ensure the instance folder exists
    with contextlib.suppress(OSError):
        os.makedirs(app.instance_path)

    @app.route("/ping")
    def ping() -> str:
        return "pong!"

    return app
```

import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<Steps>

1. The `create_app` function creates a new Flask app

   This function is automatically called by Flask when the app is run.
   It accepts an optional `test_config` parameter which can be used to pass in configuration values.

2. Config is set

   The app is configured with a `SECRET_KEY` and a `DATABASE` path.
   The `SECRET_KEY` is used by Flask and extensions to keep data safe.
   The `DATABASE` is the path where the SQLite database file will be stored.

   :::caution
   If this were ever going to be run in production or as a normal application the secret key should be very secure and not just `DEV`.
   :::

3. A method to load external configuration

   The `config.py` file in the instance folder can be used to set configuration values.
   This is useful for setting values that should not be in version control.

4. The `instance` folder is created

   The `instance` folder is created if it does not exist.
   This folder is used to store files that should not be in version control.
   `with contextlib.suppress(OSError):` is used to suppress the error if the folder already exists. This is similar to a `try` and `except` block.

5. A ping route is added

    A simple route is added to check if the app is running.
    When the `/ping` route is accessed, the app will return `pong!`.

</Steps>

## Running the app

To run our app we can run:

```bash
flask --app flaskapp run
```

:::tip
We can also run the app in debug mode by adding `--debug` to the end.

## Adding the blog blueprint

Create a new file called `blog.py` and add the following code to it.

```python
// flaskapp/blog.py
from flask import Blueprint

blog = Blueprint('blog', __name__)

@blog.route('/')
def index():
    return 'Hello from the blog'
```

This blueprint will be used to handle all the blog related routes.

## Registering the blueprint

Update the `__init__.py` file to register the blueprint.

```diff lang="python"
// flaskapp/__init__.py
    # ensure the instance folder exists
    with contextlib.suppress(OSError):
        os.makedirs(app.instance_path)

+   from .blog import blog
+   app.register_blueprint(blog)

    @app.route("/ping")
    def ping() -> str:
        return "pong!"
```

## Setting up the database

Following from how we set up the blog blueprint, we can create a new file called `db.py` and add the following code to it.

```python
// flaskapp/db.py
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from sqlalchemy.orm import DeclarativeBase

class Base(DeclarativeBase):
    pass

db = SQLAlchemy(model_class=Base)

class Post(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    title = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    content = db.Column(db.Text, nullable=False)

def init_app(app: Flask):
    db.init_app(app)
    with app.app_context():
        db.create_all()
```

<Steps>

1. The `Base` class is created as a base for the databases

2. The `db` object is created

   The `db` object is created using the `SQLAlchemy` class.
   The `model_class` parameter is set to the `Base` class to use it as the base for all models.

3. The `Post` model is created

    The `Post` model is created with an `id`, `title`, and `content` column.
    The `id` column is the primary key.
    The `title` and `content` columns are set to be not nullable.

4. The `init_app` function is created

    The `init_app` function is created to initialise the database.
    The `db` object is initialised with the app.
    The database is created with the `create_all` method.

</Steps>

In the `__init__.py` file, import the `db` module and call the `init_app` function.

```diff lang="python"
// flaskapp/__init__.py
    # ensure the instance folder exists
    with contextlib.suppress(OSError):
        os.makedirs(app.instance_path)

+    from .db import init_app
+    init_app(app)

    from .blog import blog
    app.register_blueprint(blog)
```

With the database set up, we can now add a route to add a post to the database.

```diff lang="python"
// flaskapp/blog.py
+ from .db import Post, db

...

+@bp.route("/add_post")
+def add_post():
+    post = Post(title="Hello World", content="This is my first post")
+    db.session.add(post)
+    db.session.commit()
+    return "Post added"
```
