## Functions

Functions allows you to create a sequence of code that can be called repeatedly so you don't need to write everything out multiple times.

To create a function, you use `def` followed by your name for the function followed by `():`. Then on the next line you'll start your code. If you want you function to give a result at the end, you'll use `return` and then the result you want to return.

```python
def my_func():
    x = 5
    y = 6
    sum = x + y
    return sum
```

To use a function you've created, it's the same as using `print()`, `input()`, `range()` etc.

```python
total = my_func()
```

You can also give a function something called parameters. These are variables that can be used inside the function itself. This allows you to create a general function that can give different results based on what you input. These are put inside the `()` in your method definition.

```python
def my_func(x, y):
    sum = x + y
    return sum


total = my_func(4, 10) # This will return 4 + 10
```

## Docstrings

Docstrings are used to document a function, its parameters, what it does, and its output. These are block comments put at the start of a function, surrounded by `"""`.

```python
def my_func(x, y):
    """Adds 2 numbers and returns the result

    Args:
        x (int): The first number to be added
        y (int): The second number to be added

    Returns:
        int: The sum of x and y
    """
    sum = x + y
    return sum
```

The docstring style above is a common one called Google Docstring Style. It's an easy docstring format to remember and is quite clear. There are other styles you can use, however.
