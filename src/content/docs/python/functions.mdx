## Functions

Functions allows you to create a sequence of code that can be called repeatedly so you don't need to write everything out multiple times.

To create a function, you use `def` followed by your name for the function followed by `():`. Then on the next line you'll start your code. If you want you function to give a result at the end, you'll use `return` and then the result you want to return.

```python
def my_func():
    x = 5
    y = 6
    sum = x + y
    return sum
```

To use a function you've created, it's the same as using `print()`, `input()`, `range()` etc.

```python
total = my_func()
```

You can also give a function something called parameters. These are variables that can be used inside the function itself. This allows you to create a general function that can give different results based on what you input. These are put inside the `()` in your method definition.

```python
def my_func(x, y):
    sum = x + y
    return sum


total = my_func(4, 10) # This will return 4 + 10
```

You can give parameters a default value. This enables the parameter to be used in your function without explicitly needing to give the function a value for that parameter when you call it. To do this, you add `=value` after a parameter, where `value` will be what you want to set as the default. You can override this default when calling the function and replace it with a given value.

```python
def my_func(x, y=10):
    sum = x + y
    return sum


total = my_func(4) # This will return 4 + 10
total = my_func(4, y=15) # This will return 4 + 15
```

:::note
If you do not give a parameter a default value, you must provide a value for it when you call the function. Otherwise you will get an error similar to this: `TypeError: my_func() missing 1 required positional argument: 'x'`

## Docstrings

Docstrings are used to document a function, its parameters, what it does, and its output. These are block comments put at the start of a function, surrounded by `"""`. Visual Studio (and VS Code) use something called Intellisense, which is a code-completion tool. One of the things this does is it will show you what your docstrings look like when rendered properly.

```python
def my_func(x, y):
    """Adds 2 numbers and returns the result

    Args:
        x (int): The first number to be added
        y (int): The second number to be added

    Returns:
        int: The sum of x and y
    """
    sum = x + y
    return sum
```

The render for this docstring using intellisense looks like this:

The docstring style above is a common one called [Google Docstring Style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#s3.8.1-comments-in-doc-strings). It's an easy docstring format to remember and is quite clear. There are other styles you can use, however.
