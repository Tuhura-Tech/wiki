Turtle is a visual extension for python, but its still python code, utilising the same python rules and syntax.
Although the principles behind turtle graphics can be extended to include 3D space this page will be focusing on 2D graphics.
Turtle is a pre installed python library however a pip install might be needed.

when first starting a new file, the turtle library must be called. There are two options for calling the turtle library.

```python
    from turtle import *
# or
    from turtle import Turtle
```

:::note[The above not working?]
If you see something like this error: No module named '\_tkinter', go ahead and write this in your terminal:

```python
sudo apt install python3-tkinter
```

_Then_ you can call the turtle library.
