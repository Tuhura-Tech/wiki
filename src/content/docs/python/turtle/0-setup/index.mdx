## Setting up turtle for use

Turtle is a visual extension for python, but its still python code, utilising the same python rules and syntax. Although the principles behind turtle graphics can be extended to include three-dimensional space this page will be focusing on two-dimensional graphics.
Turtle is a pre installed python library  however a pip install might be needed.

when first starting a new file, the turtle library must be called. There are two options for calling the turtle library. 

``` python
    from turtle import *
# or 
    from turtle import Turtle
 ```

> Note: that naming the file turtle.py will confuse the import command and cause it and the turtle library to fail.
