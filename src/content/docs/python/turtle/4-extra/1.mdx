In this challenge, you will use for loops, variables, and lists to draw a colourful pattern with Turtle. 
Let’s see if you can create a fun pattern or shape using everything you’ve learned!

## Make a Pattern
Try to:
 - Draws 5 squares in different colours.
 - Each square should get a little bigger than the last one.
 - The Turtle should move to a different place before drawing the next square.

:::note[Remember the functions]
```python
t.color() # to change the turtle’s colour
t.forward() # to move the turtle forward
t.left() # to turn the turtle
t.penup() # and t.pendown() to move without drawing
t.bgcolor() # to set a background colour
```

  <summary>Hints</summary>
  - Use a for loop to repeat the drawing of squares.
  - Store your colours in a list so the Turtle can change colours for each square.
  - Use variables to change the size of each square.
  - Try using turtle.penup() and turtle.pendown() to move the Turtle without drawing a line between squares.

## Bonus Challenge:
Can you make the turtle rotate a little more each time it draws a square?
Try using the modulo symbol to repeat some behavior after a few loops!
