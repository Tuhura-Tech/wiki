## A Hexagon
Using the concepts of turning by degrees, moving to specific coordinates, and combining movements,
try to draw a hexagon.

#### Remember
 - You'll need to use the goto function to position the turtle at the starting point.
 - Use forward() and right() (or left()) with the correct angles to create the star.
 - Use penup() and pendown() to lift and place the turtle's pen without drawing extra lines.

  A hexagon has six sides, so each turn should be 60 degrees.
