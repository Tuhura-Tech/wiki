## Forwards and Backwards
The number you put in the brackets will be the amount of pixels your turtle moves.
``` python
forward(100)
backward(100)
```
This moves your turtle forward and backward by 100 pixels.

## Left and Right

You can add in equations inside the brackets, and the program will calculate it for you!

``` python
left(360/6)
right(90)
```
This turns your turtle left 60 degrees and right 90 degrees.

:::tip[How do degrees work?]
  The syntax for the left angle in the above code would make a six sided object. This makes the angle at 60 degrees.
  So this means:
   - 360 degrees is a full circle - the same direction.
   - 180 degrees is a half circle - the oppposite direction.
   - 90 degrees is a quarter circle - a perfect right angled turn.

## Move to a Set Location

Positioning in most languages get you to write the X and Y location inside the brackets, like `goto(x, y)`.
:::note[Remember]
X is across and Y to the sky. And (0,0) is the very center of the screen.
:::


Try these two functions. Can you see the difference between `goto` and `penup`?
``` python
goto(180, -82)
# or
penup(180, -82)
```
Explanation: Penup() moves the turtle without drawing a line from it's original
position to the desired position. The above code is positive on the x axis (180)
which is to the right on screen, negative on the Y axis (-82) which is down on the screen.
