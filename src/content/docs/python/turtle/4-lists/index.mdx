## lists

lists in turtle are the same as in base python. 
Name the list and use square brackets, separate the different items out with commas and add quotation marks before and after each word. 
the list can then be called later in the code.

``` python
list = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple"]

t = Turtle()

for i in range(6):
    t.color(list[i])
    t.forward(100)
    t.left(360/6)

#this above code works well with its range being 6 and the number of colors in the list equalling 6. however if the list is shorter then the loops value the loop will end with the end of the list. To fix this we add in i (from i in range) and % which takes whats left over in the length (len) of i (the loop) and repeats the list for the remainder of the length of i (the loop). 


t = Turtle()

for i in range(20):
    t.color(list[i % len(list)])
    t.forward(100)
    t.left(360/20)
```
In the example above the color of the turtle is being changed to the info on the list.
first t.color() is used to change the turtles colour. then the list name is added in. 


## colours
bgcolor, fillcolor, turtle color
