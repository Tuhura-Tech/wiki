## loops
loops work the same way in base python as in turtle. for loops can be particularly useful for graphic application. With loops its import to add a colon at the end of the function line, and an indent to the following lines, so the code registers what is part of the loop.

This loop will draw a square without having to type out forward and left syntax 4 times.
the words i and range are both words that can be changed not something thats recommend though, whatever you change out i or range, for will need to be changed out in other examples.

``` python
for i in range (4):
    forward (100)
    left(90)

# adding in extra detail such as a verbile number of sides
# this example would run the loop 7 times and divide 360 by 7 to find the right angle

num_sides = 7
for i in range(num_sides):
    t.forward(100)
    t.left(360/num_sides)

# for spiral shapes you can change out the forward value for i.
# this will make a square shaped spiral as it goes the value of forward increases by one more in the list, the list being i, its max value in this example is 40

for i in range (40):
    forward (i)
    left(90)
```

python can do math for you why work out calculations when you can leave the equation in the code.
work smarter not harder
``` python
# making a five sized shape
for i in range (5):
    forward (100)
    left(360/5)
```
