description: Details on how to contribute to this Wiki
---

This is a guide to contributing to the wiki, the associated technical knowledge that's required along with how the content is layed out.

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

This project is built on-top of the [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build/) framework and utilises it to convert the content written in markdown to webpages.

Inside of the project, you'll see the following folders and files:

import { FileTree } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

<FileTree>

- public/
- src/
  - assets/
    - content/
      - docs/
      - config.ts
  - env.d.ts
- astro.config.mjs
- package.json
- tsconfig.json

</FileTree>

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

### Modifying existing content

Modifying existing content is straightforward as it can be done through the GitHub web UI once you click the `Edit page` button on the associated wiki page. It can also be done through a local copy of the wiki by modifying the md/mdx file.


### Adding new content

Adding new content is a bit more involved then modifying new content as you have to create the required folder if needed and then add the new files into `astro.config.mjs`.

Check out the [Style Guide](/tuhura-tech/style) for contribution style best practices 

<details>
  <summary>Adding new <ins>tutorial</ins> content...</summary>
  File Structure:
  1. Refer to the python turtle folder.
      a. You need to make your tutorial into a folder, and add your sub-folder as `0-firstStep`, `1-secondStep`, `2-thirdStep`, etc.
      b. Inside these sub-folders, you will need one `index.mdx` file, and then 0 or more files named `1.mdx`, `2.mdx`, etc.
  4. When you add your directory into the `astro.config.mjs` file, the link needs to include your first sub-folder.
  
:::note[You are required to add the following to your files]
At the start of the index file
```md
type: tutorial
unitTitle: 'My Unit Title'
title: 'My Page Title'
```
At the start of the [number].mdx files
```md
type: tutorial
title: 'My Page Title'
```
To import necessary modules
```md
import Checklist from '/src/components/tutorial/Checklist.astro';
import Box from '/src/components/tutorial/Box.astro';
import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
```

At the end of **every** mdx file
```md
<Box icon="check-list">
## Checklist name
<Checklist>
- [ ] Things the user should've done...
</Checklist>
</Box>
```

</details>

### ðŸ§ž Commands
