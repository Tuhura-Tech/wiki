## Next Steps

You've just made your very own infinite 3D racing game! As you understand how to procedurally generate a track, it's now all yours to add on new features and code these to procedurally generate!
Here's some ideas for what your next steps could be:

<Steps>
1. Making a scenic background to drive along to, such as trees, mountains, and clouds. 
    The code to make these will be extremely similar to your infinite track!
    So instead of randomising your track, you can randomise how big the trees are, how many mountains there'll be, what colour the sky is...
2. Collect randomised powerups (like extra boosts) as you drive along the track.
</Steps>

Thanks for following along this far! Happy Godoting and have fun.

## Checklist: As I drive along the track,
<Checklist>
- [ ] the scenic background full of trees and mountains change.
- [ ] there are random powerups I can collect.
