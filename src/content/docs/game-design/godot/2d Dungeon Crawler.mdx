This is a guide to making a 2-dimensional dungeon crawling game in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). If you are unfamiliar with Godot, check out the [Godot basics](/game-design/godot/basics) doc as this tutorial assumes basic knowledge of navigating and using the Godot Engine.

:::note[Version]
This guide is up-to-date with Godot 4.2 stable official release but will most likely work with any 4.x release.
:::

We'll be making a game in which the player explores a multi-floor dungeon in a top-down perspective. This project will include:
- Movement 
- Attacking
- Health loss & Gain 
- Pickups (Coins & Potions)
- Enemies

We will not be creating our own assets as part of this project, although you are of course welcome to!

We'll instead be using a free asset pack by Ox72 on Itch.IO which [can be found here](https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii) Just click *Download now* followed by *No thanks, just take me to the download* and download the file called *0x72_DungeonTilesetII_v1.7.zip*


## Making the project
Set up a Basic 2D project, using the Forward+ Renderer. Let's start by importing our assets. 
First let's create a new folder, and call it something like 'Assets' 

Then, let's extract the assets from the folder we downloaded, and at them into our Assets folder. Mine looks like this, but it's fine if yours looks slightly different.

Let's also create two new top level folders called **Scripts** and **Scenes**

TODO: Image here


To ensure our pixel art assets look crisp and not blurred we'll want to make one quick change.

Using the buttons in the top left of the screen, select **Project -> Project settings** In this menu, select the **General** tab, and scroll until you see the **Rendering** header. Under this, select **Textures**

Change **Default Texture Filter** from **Linear** to **Nearest**

TODO: Settings image


## Creating the Player

Great! Let's start by making a basic version of our player character that will let us move around. We'll worry about more complicated things like attacking later.

Start by creating a new 2D Scene, with a **CharacterBody2D** as the root node.

Give the **CharacterBody2D** a name like **Player** and give it two children:

A **CollisionShape2D** and an **AnimatedSprite2D**

Here's how my scene looks with no other modifications:

TODO: Player scene basic img

Let's hit **Ctrl + S** and save this scene in our **Scenes** folder, call it something like **Player.tscn**

### Animations

Let's give ourselves something to look at! Click on the **AnimatedSprite2D** and in the inspector, under **Animation** you'll see **\<Empty>** in the **Spriteframes** field.
Click on **\<Empty>** and create a new **Spriteframes** Click on the **Spriteframes** you created. This will open a new window at the bottom of the screen.

This is where we'll create our player's animations. Rename the *General* animation to *Idle* and click the *Add frames from File* Button (The folder icon)

Navigate to your *assets/frames* folder, and decide which character you want to be your player. I'll be using the Plague Doctor. Using Shift + Click select all the frames for your character labeled *Idle* (This should be four frames) then open them.

TODO: Image

You'll see them added to the animation timeline. We'll want to select two things in the timeline. The **Loop** Button (To ensure the animation loops) and the **Play on start button** (To ensure the animation plays automatically)
Let's also increase the FPS to 8 so that the animation plays a little faster. 

Hit play to test! You'll see the player now has an idle animation that loops!

Let's add our characters walking animation. Add a new animation using the **Add animation** Button and call it something like "Walk"

TODO: add animation button image

Do the same thing we did to grab the frames for the idle animation, but this time, grab all the frames labeled "Run" it should again be 4 frames. We want this animation to loop, but we **don't** want it to autoplay. Let's also give this a framerate of 8 FPS.

TODO: Walk anim image

great! That's our animations all done!

### Collision and Movement

Now that we have something to look at, let's give our player a hitbox. Open the inspector for the **CollisionShape2D** we added, and add a new shape in the **empty** shape field.
It's a good idea to use a **CapsuleShape** as it will make us less likely to get stuck on corners. Position and adjust the capsule so that it's *slightly* smalle than the sprite for our player.
Mine looks like this:

TODO: image CollisionShape2D

Great! Our player now has collision. We'll do one more thing while we're here, which is give our player a script to handle movement. Right click on the **CharacterBody2D** and Attach a script. Call it something like "player_movement" and make sure we're saving it 
in our Scripts folder. We also need to make sure we **untick** the **template** box as we will not be using the template! This is because the template is designed for gravity based platformers.

With our script created and attached, let's get to programming our movement!

First, let's set up a variable to control our speed.

```gdscript
@export var speed = 200
```

The **\@export** tag will allow us to easily edit our speed variable, without needing to open the script!

Then, we'll want to use Godots built in **_physics_process(delta):** function for our movement logic. Inside that we'll want to get the combined vector of all the inputs the player is pressing.

```gdscript
func _physics_process(delta):
    var direction = Input.get_vector("ui_left", "ui_right", "ui_up", "ui_down")
```

We'll then multiply this vector by our speed, and then invoke Godots built in **move_and_slide()** function

```gdscript
velocity = direction * speed

move_and_slide()
```

giving us a final script that looks like this:

```gdscript
extends CharacterBody2D

@export var speed = 200

func _physics_process(delta):
    var direction = Input.get_vector("ui_left", "ui_right", "ui_up", "ui_down")
    velocity = direction * speed

    move_and_slide()
```
For now our movement is controlled using the arrow keys, but we'll go over how to map it to whatever we want later in the guide.
