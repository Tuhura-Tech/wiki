This is a guide to making a 2-dimensional dungeon crawling game in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). If you are unfamiliar with Godot, check out the [Godot basics](/game-design/godot/basics) doc as this tutorial assumes basic knowledge of navigating and using the Godot Engine.

:::note[Version]
This guide is up-to-date with Godot 4.2 stable official release but will most likely work with any 4.x release.
:::

We'll be making a game in which the player explores a multi-floor dungeon in a top-down perspective. This project will include:
- Movement 
- Attacking
- Health loss & Gain 
- Pickups (Coins & Potions)
- Enemies

We will not be creating our own assets as part of this project, although you are of course welcome to!

We'll instead be using a free asset pack by Ox72 on Itch.IO which [can be found here](https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii) Just click *Download now* followed by *No thanks, just take me to the download* and download the file called *0x72_DungeonTilesetII_v1.7.zip*


## Making the project
Set up a Basic 2D project, using the Forward+ Renderer. Let's start by importing our assets. 
First let's create a new folder, and call it something like 'Assets' 

Then, let's extract the assets from the folder we downloaded, and at them into our Assets folder. Mine looks like this, but it's fine if yours looks slightly different.

Let's also create two new top level folders called **Scripts** and **Scenes**

TODO: Image here


To ensure our pixel art assets look crisp and not blurred we'll want to make one quick change.

Using the buttons in the top left of the screen, select **Project -> Project settings** In this menu, select the **General** tab, and scroll until you see the **Rendering** header. Under this, select **Textures**

Change **Default Texture Filter** from **Linear** to **Nearest**

## Creating the Player

Great! Let's start by making a basic version of our player character that will let us move around. We'll worry about more complicated things like attacking later.

Start by creating a new 2D Scene, with a **CharacterBody2D** as the root node.

Give the **CharacterBody2D** a name like **Player** and give it two children:

A **CollisionShape2D** and an **AnimatedSprite2D**

Here's how my scene looks with no other modifications:

TODO: Player scene basic img

Let's hit **Ctrl + S** and save this scene in our **Scenes** folder, call it something like **Player.tscn**

Let's give ourselves something to look at. Click on the **AnimatedSprite2D** and in the inspector, under **Animation** you'll see **\<Empty>** in the **Spriteframes** field.
Click on **\<Empty>** and create a new **Spriteframes** Click on the **Spriteframes** you created. This will open a new window at the bottom of the screen.

This is where we'll create our player's animations. Rename the *General* animation to *Idle* and click the *Add frames from File* Button (The folder icon)

Navigate to your *assets/frames* folder, and decide which character you want to be your player. I'll be using the Plague Doctor. Using Shift + Click select all the frames for your character labeled *Idle* (This should be four frames) then open them.

TODO: Image

You'll see them added to the animation timeline. We'll want to select two things in the timeline. The **Loop** Button (To ensure the animation loops) and the **Play on start button** (To ensure the animation plays automatically)
Let's also increase the FPS to 8 so that the animation plays a little faster. 

Hit play to test! You'll see the player now has an idle animation that loops!
