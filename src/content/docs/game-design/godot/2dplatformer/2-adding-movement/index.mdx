## Adding Movement

Now we are going to add gravity and movement to the player. 

<Steps>

1. Go back to your Player scene and attach a script by right clicking the player node and clicking “Attach Script”. Click “Create” as the defaults are what we want. Now if you run your game, you should be able to run around. 
	:::tip
	You may want to reduce your speed and jump height, depending on how you want the game to feel (I recommend a speed of 150 and a jump velocity of -300). 
	:::

2. In Project > Project Settings > Input Map, we will create other keys for the player to use. In the "add new action" box, type in something like left and then click add.

3. On the right, click the plus button and and then press a key to represent it. E.g. for left you could use the left arrow key. Repeat the steps for right and jump.

4. Now go into the Player script and change the `"ui_left"`, `"ui_right"` etc. to the inputs you made before.

5. You may notice that your player doesn't flip when going to the left, nor does the animation change from idle to run when you're moving. To solve this, change your Player script to this:
	```gdscript
	extends CharacterBody2D
	## Class for the player, controlled by the user


	# Constants
	const SPEED = 150.0
	const JUMP_VELOCITY = -300.0

	# In-scene nodes
	@onready var sprite_node = $AnimatedSprite


	# Runs consistently as much as possible, for physics
	func _physics_process(delta: float) -> void:
		# Add the gravity.
		if not is_on_floor():
			velocity += get_gravity() * delta
		
		# Handle jump.
		if Input.is_action_just_pressed("jump") and is_on_floor():
			velocity.y = JUMP_VELOCITY
		
		# Get the input direction and handle the movement/deceleration.
		var direction := Input.get_axis("left", "right")
		if direction:
			velocity.x = direction * SPEED
		else:
			velocity.x = move_toward(velocity.x, 0, SPEED)
		
		# Move the player
		move_and_slide()


	# Runs every frame, for anything non-physics like visual things
	func _process(_delta: float) -> void:
		if velocity.x > 0:
			sprite_node.flip_h = false
		elif velocity.x < 0:
			sprite_node.flip_h = true
		if abs(velocity.x) > 0:
			sprite_node.animation = "run"
		else:
			sprite_node.animation = "idle"

	```
