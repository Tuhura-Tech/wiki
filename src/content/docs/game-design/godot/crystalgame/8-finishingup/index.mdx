If you like, you can leave your game there, it's a fully functional game, and if you've made it this far you should be proud of yourself!
But, if you want to polish it up a little, here are some ideas, although you'll be on your own!

1. Modify the level to include walls to prevent the player from falling, as well as platforms to jump on.
2. Add extra spawners
3. Add more enemy types
4. Have the enemy spawners scale up their spawnrate (Remember, you can easily access the gametimer from anywhere)

If you want to look over my version of the project, you can access the Github repository here: [Link](https://github.com/lillianhidet/THT3DGame)

Remember, if you're ever lost, the [Godot Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/index.html) is the best place to start!

## Where to next

From here, you can make the project your own! Add your own models, music, and textures. Add whole new mechanics! Look into gamefeel concepts and 'juice' the game up!

I can't wait to see what you make!
