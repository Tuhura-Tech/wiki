## The Timer

Our game's win condition is going to be surviving until a timer runs out, without losing beforehand. For this, as you may have guessed, we'll use a Timer again, just like we did with the spawners.

However, we don't really need our timer to have its own scene, as we'll only have one in our scene. This makes this an excellent time to talk about **Autoload** scripts! Which are Godot's equivalent to Singletons if you're familiar from other Languages.
<Steps>
1. To create an **Autoload** we'll open our **Project Settings** and tab over to the **Autoload** tab. In the **Node Name** Section, call it "game_timer" and confirm to create the script.
	
	Clicking on the "res://game_timer.gd" field will open our script.

2. First, let's set up our variables.

	```gdscript
	var game_length = 60
	var HUD
	var timer
	```

	Our first variable here will determine how many seconds it takes before we win the game. Something to keep in mind, because **Autoload** scripts don't have scenes, we can't use Exported variables.

3. Our other two variables will be assigned in our **_ready()** function, which we'll set up now:

	```gdscript
	func _ready():
		HUD = get_tree().root.get_node("World/HUD")
		timer = get_tree().create_timer(game_length)
		timer.timeout.connect(win_game)
	```
	First, as we did in our Objective, we'll get a reference to our HUD. Then we'll create a timer with a length set by our **game_length** variable. 
	
4. Then connect it to a function that we'll create now.

	```gdscript
	func win_game():
		HUD.show_win_lose("You Win!")
		start_close_game()
	```

	This function displays "You Win!" on our UI, and then calls another function we'll create now, which will close the game after a delay.

5. Let's also create a function to close the game after we lose

	```gdscript
	func start_close_game():
		var tq = get_tree().create_timer(2)
		tq.timeout.connect(get_tree().quit)
	```
	Here we again create a new timer, but this time, attach it to a built in Godot function which will close the game. In this case, the game will close after 2 seconds.

6. Finally, we need to update the text on our **time_label** to reflect the amount of time left on our timer. Thankfully, Godot makes this easy for us. We'll do this directly in the **_process(delta)** function.

	first, let's get the remaining time, and covert it to a string.
	```gdscript
	var time = str(timer.get_time_left())
	```
7. We could just leave our variable here, but it would have a lot of extra characters after the decimal place which will go off the edge of the screen, so let's trim it before we update the label.


	```gdscript
	time = time.erase(5, 15)
	HUD.update_time(time)
	```
	This trims any characters after the 5th (Which keeps two decimal places) and then updates the text.
</Steps>

## Back to the Objective Script

Our final step is to make sure our game also closes after two seconds when we lose. Because we've made our timer an **Autoload** it can be accessed easily from anywhere! 

Let's go to our **Objective** script.

And simply add

```gdscript
GameTimer.start_close_game()
```

Directly after the line where we update the label to say "You Lose!"

And that's it! We have a fully functioning 3D game with gameplay, UI, a win condition, and a lose condition! 

Congratulations, you've just made your very own 3D game!
