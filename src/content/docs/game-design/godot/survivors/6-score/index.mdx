This one is going to be quick, because it's simple.
<Steps>

1. In your singleton, add a `score` variable and start it at 0.

2. Add the built-in `_exit_tree` function to your enemy, and in it add one to the singleton's score variable.

3. As a child of your camera in your player scene, add a **CanvasLayer** node with a **Label** child. Anchor the **Label** to the top of the screen.

4. Give the **Label** a quick built-in script:

    ```gdscript
    extends Label


    func _process(_delta):
        text = "Score: " + str(Singleton.score)
    ```

    This is awfully inefficient since it really doesn't need to check every frame. But, it'll work for now.

</Steps>

:::note[Making it efficient]
This one is really easy and recommended.

Making it efficient is pretty simple, just not as quick and easy.

Make a function in the singleton that increased score by the passed parameter. Whenever you need to increase score, use that instead. In the function increase the score but then also emit a signal.

In the ready function of the score display label connect that signal to a function that updates the text of the label.

Instead of checking once every frame this only updates whenever it's needed, much better.

The reason this isn't just the guide instead, is for contrast. In the future you should keep as much out of the `_process` and `_physics_process` functions as physically possible.
