This is a guide to making a 2-dimensional dungeon crawling game in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). If you are unfamiliar with Godot, check out the [Godot basics](/game-design/godot/basics) doc as this tutorial assumes basic knowledge of navigating and using the Godot Engine.

:::note[Version]
This guide is up-to-date with Godot 4.3 stable official release but will most likely work with any 4.x release.
:::

We'll be making a game in which the player explores a multi-floor dungeon in a top-down perspective. This project will include:
- Movement 
- Attacking
- Health loss & Gain 
- Pickups (Coins & Potions)
- Enemies

We will not be creating our own assets as part of this project, although you are of course welcome to!

We'll instead be using a free asset pack by Ox72 on Itch.IO which [can be found here](https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii) Just click *Download now* followed by *No thanks, just take me to the download* and download the file called *0x72_DungeonTilesetII_v1.7.zip*


## Making the project

[Importing](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/assets_pipeline/import_process.html)
:::


Set up a Basic 2D project, using the Forward+ Renderer. Let's start by importing our assets. 
First let's create a new folder, and call it something like 'Assets' 

Then, let's extract the assets from the folder we downloaded, and at them into our Assets folder. Mine looks like this, but it's fine if yours looks slightly different.

Let's also create two new top level folders called **Scripts** and **Scenes**

![Folders](/src/assets/godot/dungeonCrawler/folders.png)


To ensure our pixel art assets look crisp and not blurred we'll want to make one quick change.

Using the buttons in the top left of the screen, select **Project -> Project settings** In this menu, select the **General** tab, and scroll until you see the **Rendering** header. Under this, select **Textures**

Change **Default Texture Filter** from **Linear** to **Nearest**
