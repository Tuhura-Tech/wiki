This is a guide to making a 2-dimensional dungeon crawling game in [Godot](https://godotengine.org/). If you are unfamiliar with Godot, check out the [Godot basics](/game-design/godot/basics) doc as this tutorial assumes basic knowledge of navigating and using the Godot Engine.

:::note[Version]
This guide is up-to-date with Godot 4.3 stable official release, and will likely work with any version of Godot newer than 4.3. Due to the use of **TileMapLayers** which were introduced in 4.3, this tutorial isn't compatible with any version pre 4.3

## What you'll be making

![Screenshot preview of the game](/src/assets/godot/dungeonCrawler/screenshot.png)

In this tutorial, you'll work step by step through creating your very own Dungeon Crawler! In this game, the player will navigate through a multi-level dungeon of your design, full of enemies to fight, and treasure to collect!

You'll learn to:
- Create an animated player character
- Create enemies that chase and attack the player
- Create a User Interface that tracks health and points
- Switch levels 
- Design 2D Combat

Let's jump right in!

## Making the project

:::note[Godot Documentation]

[Importing](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/assets_pipeline/import_process.html)
:::


We won't be creating our own assets as part of this project, we'll instead be using a free asset pack by Ox72 on Itch.IO which [can be found here](https://0x72.itch.io/dungeontileset-ii) Just click *Download now* followed by *No thanks, just take me to the download* and download the file called *0x72_DungeonTilesetII_v1.7.zip*

Create a new 2D project, using the Forward+ Renderer. 

Let's start by importing our assets!

<Steps>

1.  First let's create a new folder, and call it 'Assets'
    Then, let's extract the assets from the folder we downloaded, and at them into our Assets folder. Mine looks like this, but it's fine if yours looks slightly different.

    ![Assets](/src/assets/godot/dungeonCrawler/assets.png)

2. Let's also create two new top level folders called 'Scripts' and 'Scenes'

    ![Folders](/src/assets/godot/dungeonCrawler/folders.png)

3. To ensure our pixel art assets look crisp and not blurred we'll want to make one quick change.
    Using the buttons in the top left of the screen, select **Project -> Project settings** In this menu, select the **General** tab, and scroll until you see the **Rendering** header. Under this, select **Textures**
    Change **Default Texture Filter** from **Linear** to **Nearest**
