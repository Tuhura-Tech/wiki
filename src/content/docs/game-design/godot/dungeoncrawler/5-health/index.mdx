## Giving our player Health

Let's start setting up our health system on the player side!
<Steps>
1. We'll start by adding a new Node to our player Scene, as a child of the root **CharacterBody2D** node. The node should be of type **Area2D** 
	give the **Area2D** a child of type **CollisionShape2D** rename the Area2D to "Hitbox." 

	In the **Inspector** of the **Area2D** Navigate to the **Collision** section. Deselect all numbers under the **Layer** Section, and ensure *only* 2 is selected under the **Mask** Section.

	Give the **CollisionShape2D** a shape, ideally a rectangle or circle, and make it *slightly* bigger than the shape for the **CharacterBody2D's** **CollisionShape2D**

2. Let's give the **Area2D** one more child of type **Timer** and name it "damageTimer" this timer will be used to determine how quickly we can take damage again after being hurt, think of it as invulnerability time!
	In the timer's inspector, set its **Wait Time** field to 0.5s

	Great! this **Area2D** will be used to detect collision with enemies, potions, and coins! For now we'll just be setting it up to handle health, both healing and damage.

3. Let's attach a script to the **Area2D** (that we named "Hitbox") and call it "hitbox.gd"

4. This script is going to get a little complicated, as it's going to have to handle quite a few things. In a bigger project we would want to break its functionality up into multiple scripts, but for our scope this is fine!
	Let's break down what we need it to do:

	1. Track our health
	2. Detect collisions with potions/enemies/coins
	3. Change our health value
	4. Update the UI

5. Let's start by creating the variables we'll need, those being:

	1. The signal we'll use to talk to the UI when our health has changed
	2. While we're here, a signal for when we've collected a coin, as it'll also talk to the UI
	3. A max health, and current health value
	4. A reference to the timer we created.
	5. A boolean determining if we can take damage

	These should look something like this, using the same click + drag + ctrl method to get the reference to the **Timer**

	```gdscript
	signal on_health_changed(new_health : int)
	signal on_point_gained
	@export var max_health : int = 6
	@onready var damage_timer = $damageTimer
	var health : int
	var can_take_damage : bool = true
	```

	:::note[\@export] 
	We can use the **\@export** to modify the max health value, without editing the script!
	:::

	:::note[Health] 
	Why are we starting at 6 health? We're doing this because each point of health will represent half a heart to the UI, for a total of 3 full hearts! Using ints like this is safer than using a float,
	because what if we somehow end up with 0.001 health!
	:::

6. In our **_ready** function we'll want to set some default values, and emit the health_changed signal to send our starting health to the UI.

	```gdscript
	func _ready():
		damage_timer.connect("timeout", allow_damage)
		health = max_health
		emit_signal("on_health_changed", health)
	```

</Steps>
<Steps>
1. Right, let's get onto the most complicated function in the script, the function for taking damage! In this function, there'll be a few different possible outcomes.

	1. We can't take damage as we're currently immune. In this case. Nothing happens
	2. Otherwise we'll take damage. Emitting the signal to change the UI.
	3. If we do take damage, we might be reduced to 0 hitpoints
	4. If we are, we die! If we're not. We start our immunity timer.

2. Great! Let's write that in gdscript:

	```gdscript
	func take_damage():
		if can_take_damage:
			health = health - 1
			emit_signal("on_health_changed", health)
			
			if health <= 0:
				get_tree().paused = true
			else:
				can_take_damage = false
				damage_timer.start()
	```

2. You'll notice we connected our timer to a function called **allow_damage()** which doesn't exist, let's create that now. All it's going to do is set the **can_take_damage** boolean to **True** as unfortunately Godot doesn't let you assign a value to a variable directly via the **connect()** function.

	```gdscript
	func allow_damage():
		can_take_damage = true
	```

3. Next we'll do healing! This one is *much* easier. We just need to check if we have room to be healed (Our health is less than our max health). If we do, increase our health by 1. Then emit the signal to update the UI! We'll also want to delete the potion, so it can no longer be used.

	```gdscript
	func heal(body):
		if health < max_health:
			health = health + 1
			emit_signal("on_health_changed", health)
			body.queue_free()
	```

4. Finally, we need a function that calls our **heal** and **damage** functions based on what we've collided with. To check what type of object we've collided with, we'll be using **Groups!** These are something we'll assign to our enemies/potions/coins later.

	To check if something has collided with us, we'll need to the **on_body_entered** signal! To connect this, swap to the **Node** tab of the **Inspector** and click on the **Area2D** node in the **SceneTree** again. You'll see a list of all the signals we have available to us!
	Click the **on_body_entered** signal and press **Connect** select the **Area2D (hitbox)** node and click **Connect** 

	You'll see a new function appear in our script! On that'll be called whenever something enters this **Area2D**

	In here, we can check the **Group** of what we've collided with! Let's also add a check to see if we've collected a coin here, to save us some time later!

	```gdscript
	func _on_body_entered(body):
		if body.is_in_group("enemy"):
			take_damage()
		elif body.is_in_group("health"):
			heal(body)
		elif body.is_in_group("coin"):
			emit_signal("on_point_gained")
			body.queue_free()

	```
5. that's it! Giving us a full script that looks something like this:

	```gdscript
	extends Area2D

	signal on_health_changed(new_health : int)
	signal on_point_gained
	@export var max_health : int = 6
	@onready var damage_timer = $damageTimer
	var health : int
	var can_take_damage : bool = true

	# Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time.
	func _ready():
		damage_timer.connect("timeout", allow_damage)
		health = max_health
		emit_signal("on_health_changed", health)

	func _on_body_entered():
		if body.is_in_group("enemy"):
			take_damage()
		elif body.is_in_group("health"):
			heal(body)
		elif body.is_in_group("coin"):
			emit_signal("on_point_gained")
			body.queue_free()
			

	func take_damage():
		if can_take_damage:
			health = health - 1
			emit_signal("on_health_changed", health)
			
			if health <= 0:
				get_tree().paused = true
			else:
				can_take_damage = false
				damage_timer.start()
		
	func heal(body):
		if health < max_health:
			health = health + 1
			emit_signal("on_health_changed", health)
			body.queue_free()
		
	func allow_damage():
		can_take_damage = true
	```

	:::note[Signals] 
	If you copy and paste the above, you'll still need to manually connect the **on_body_entered** signal!
	:::

</Steps>

And that's the player side of health done! Let's move onto the UI side!

## Health UI

### UI Setup

Time to start making some UI!
<Steps>
1. Let's make a new scene, of, as you may have guessed, type **User Interface.** call the Root node "UI" 

2. Add a child of type **HBoxContainer** This is a UI element that will neatly arrange our UI elements, in this case our hearts, horizontally!

	Let's open its inspector, navigate to the **Layout** tab and change it to "Anchors." Then change the **Anchor Preset** to "top left." This will make sure that whatever the size of our screen is, the health will always be pinned to the top left!

	Rename the node to "healthContainer." When we add hearts, this will be their parent Node, controlling their position on the screen and in relation to one another. (Like making sure they don't overlap)

3. Let's also, to the **Root** node, and a child of type **Label** call it "diedLabel"

	In the inspector for this label, in the **Text** box, write "You Died!" then look for the **Theme Overrides** section, open this, find **Font Size** and change this to about 35px. 

4. Next, in the 2D view of the UI, move the Text so that it's where you want it, I placed mine in the middle of the screen. Then, as we want this to be hidden by default, click the little 'eye' icon next to the label in the **SceneTree** to hide it!
</Steps>

Great! That's all the UI setup we'll need to do for now (Though we'll come back to it later for points)

### UI Scripting

<Steps>
1. Add a script to the root node, calling it "ui.gd"

	Let's think about what we need this script to do: 
	1. Store our three different heart images
	2. Recieve signals from our player when we take damage
	3. Update our health UI.

	We'll set this up so that it automatically adjusts depending on the players **max_health** when the game is run, so you can easily have more (or less) than three hearts! 
	(Or, you could implement an item that increases your max hp!)
 
2. Thankfully, we can reference images in our filesystem the same way we can reference nodes, with the **Drag + Ctrl + Release** technique we've been using! We'll want: The full heart image, the half heart image, and the empty heart image 
	Find these in your filesystem, and drag in the references, it should look something like this: 

	```gdscript
	const UI_HEART_EMPTY = preload("res://Assets/frames/ui_heart_empty.png")
	const UI_HEART_FULL = preload("res://Assets/frames/ui_heart_full.png")
	const UI_HEART_HALF = preload("res://Assets/frames/ui_heart_half.png")
	```

3. Let's also get a reference to our **healthContainer** node, our **diedLabel** node, and create a variable to keep track of the most health we've had so far (This lets us know how many empty hearts to have!)
	We won't set this variable here, as it'll be set by whatever the most health we've had so far has been.

	```gdscript
	@onready var health_cont = $healthContainer
	@onready var died_label = $diedLabel
	var maxHealth : int = 0
	```
4. Next will be the function that our signal will call, where most of the logic will happen, so let's think about what we need it to do!

	If our health is set to 0, show the "You died text" Otherwise, If the health received is bigger than our highest health so far, make that our new highest health. Easy enough!

	```gdscript
	func changed_health(newHealth : int):
		if(newHealth == 0):
			died_label.visible = true

		if newHealth > maxHealth:
			maxHealth = newHealth
	```

5. We'll want to check if we have enough hearts currently to represent that, if we don't, we'll need to add some more. (We'll create the function for this last)

	```gdscript
		if(maxHealth/2 > health_cont.get_child_count()):
			for h in (maxHealth/2) - health_cont.get_child_count():
				add_heart()
	```

6.  We'll iterate through all the children our **healthContainer** node has, and assign an image based on the current health.

	This section may look complicated, but once you get your head around it, it's fairly simple! Spend some time looking over it, and thinking about the conditions for each heart to be drawn.
	When I was figuring out how to program this, I found it useful to draw out the hearts on paper, at different levels of health!

	```gdscript
	for i in health_cont.get_child_count():
			if (i * 2) + 1 < newHealth:
				health_cont.get_child(i).texture = UI_HEART_FULL
			elif (i * 2) < newHealth:
				health_cont.get_child(i).texture = UI_HEART_HALF
			else:
				health_cont.get_child(i).texture = UI_HEART_EMPTY
	```

7. Giving us a full **changed_health** function that looks like this:

	```gdscript
	func changed_health(newHealth : int):
		if newHealth > maxHealth:
			maxHealth = newHealth
			
		if(maxHealth/2 > health_cont.get_child_count()):
			for h in (maxHealth/2) - health_cont.get_child_count():
				add_heart()
		
		for i in health_cont.get_child_count():
			if (i * 2) + 1 < newHealth:
				health_cont.get_child(i).texture = UI_HEART_FULL
			elif (i * 2) < newHealth:
				health_cont.get_child(i).texture = UI_HEART_HALF
			else:
				health_cont.get_child(i).texture = UI_HEART_EMPTY
	```

	Not too bad!

8. Let's add that **add_heart** function, which just creates and configures another child if we need one.

	```gdscript
	func add_heart():
		var img : TextureRect = TextureRect.new()
		img.expand_mode = TextureRect.EXPAND_FIT_WIDTH
		health_cont.add_child(img)
	```

9. Let's also while we're here, add an empty function for our point system, which we'll come back to later!

	```gdscript
	func add_point():
		pass
	```

10. Save the scene as "UI.tscn"

</Steps>

### Getting things connected

<Steps>
1. Go back to your main level scene. Add a new child of type **CanvasLayer** and add your new UI scene as a child of this! (This ensures that the UI 'sticks' to the camera, rather than existing within the game)

2. *Finally,* to get everything hooked up, we just need to connect that signal! Open up **hitbox.gd**

3. First, we'll get a reference to our new **UI** scene. Put this with the other variable declarations.

	```gdscript
	@onready var ui : Control = $"../../CanvasLayer/UI"
	```

4. Then, finally, before we call the signal the first time, connect the signal with:

	```gdscript
	on_health_changed.connect(ui.changed_health)
	```
	we'll also connect our point signal with:

	```gdscript
	on_point_gained.connect(ui.add_point)
	```
</Steps>

Run your game! And you should have 3 hearts! Great!
