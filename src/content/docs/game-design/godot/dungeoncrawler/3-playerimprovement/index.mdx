:::


Let's spend some time further improving our player. Let's implement some different controls (Well be doing WASD, but you can using any controls you like)
make sure our animation changes to our walking animation when we move, and make sure our sprite faces in the direction we're moving.

We'll also be implementing attacking, but we'll do that in its own section!

## Input mapping

<Steps>
1. To change our inputs, we'll first need to set up our **Input Map** to do this, we'll navigate to **Project -> Project Settings** in the top left of the workspace.

2. Then, open the **Input Map** tab.

3. We'll add our new Inputs by typing a name for each of them in the **Add New Action** box and hitting add. 

	I'll be calling mine "Up" "Down" "Left" "Right" and i'll also add one called "Attack"

	![Input Actions](/src/assets/godot/dungeonCrawler/inputmappreinputs.png)

4. To add buttons to these, we'll hit the "+" to the right of each action, we'll then physically press the key we want to assign on our keyboard, and hit "Ok"

	For my **Attack** action i'll be using **Left Click* for which you'll want to physically click *once* inside the **Listening for input** box.

	Here's what my inputs look like:

	![Input Actions with buttons](/src/assets/godot/dungeonCrawler/inputswithbuttons.png)

	If you're happy with your inputs, you can then hit **Close** at the bottom of the screen. Let's navigate back to our **player_movement.gd** script. This can be done by opening our **player** scene, clicking on the **CharacterBody2D** and clicking the **Script** tab at the top of the screen.

5. To change our inputs, all we need to do is change the predefined inputs to what we called ours!

	:::Note[Case Sensitivity] 
	What you named your input actions *is* case sensitive
	:::

	So, "ui_left" becomes "Left"
	"ui_right" becomes "Right" and so on!

	leaving that line in our script looking like this:

	```gdscript
    	var direction = Input.get_vector("Left", "Right", "Up", "Down")
	```
</Steps>
if you run your game, you'll notice your inputs are now changed!

We won't assign our Attack option just yet, but it's good we've created it already.


## Animation switching

To change our animation depending on if we're moving or not, we'll only need to add a few lines to our script. But first, we'll need a reference to our **AnimatedSprite2D** in our script.

We can do this easily, by **Clicking** and **Dragging** our **AnimatedSprite2D** into our script, making sure we hold **Ctrl** on the keyboard after grabbing it, but before dropping it.

We'll want to drop it below the speed variable declaration

```gdscript
@export var speed = 200
@onready var animated_sprite_2d = $AnimatedSprite2D
```

if it doesn't look like this, delete the line and try again, making sure you're holding **Ctrl** on your keyboard after picking it up.

Great! Let's get to changing our animation!

<Steps>

1. Under where we set our velocity, we'll simply add a check to see if our velocity is anything other than 0 and change our animation based on that!

	We can check this simply with:

	```gdscript
	if velocity != Vector2.ZERO:
	```
	:::note[Vector2s] 
	Why can't we just do velocity != 0? This is because velocity actually contains both our X (Horizontal) and Y (Vertical) velocity, so we need to make sure **Both** aren't zero.
	:::

2. Then, we can play our run animation!

	```gdscript
	if velocity != Vector2.ZERO:
    	animated_sprite_2d.play("walk")
	```

3. If we're not moving, let's play our idle

	```gdscript
	else:
		animated_sprite_2d.play("idle")
	```

4. Giving us a movement script that looks like this:

	```gdscript
	extends CharacterBody2D

	@export var speed = 200
	@onready var animated_sprite_2d = $AnimatedSprite2D

	func _physics_process(delta):
		var direction = Input.get_vector("Left", "Right", "Up", "Down")
		velocity = direction * speed
		if velocity != Vector2.ZERO:
			animated_sprite_2d.play("walk")
		else:
			animated_sprite_2d.play("idle")

		move_and_slide()
	```
</Steps>	

Play your game, and you'll notice your animation changes when you move!

## Sprite facing

To flip our player based on the direction we're moving, all we really need to do is add another If to check only the **Horizontal** part of our velocity, as thankfully the **AnimatedSprite2D** node has a built-in way to flip our sprite!

I'll be adding this section **beneath** the animation section, but before the **move_and_slide()** function call.

<Steps>

1. Let's start by checking the Horizontal portion of our movement:

	```gdscript
	if(velocity.x < 0):
	```
2. If our x velocity is less than 0 (moving to the left) we want to flip our sprite.

	```gdscript
		animated_sprite_2d.flip_h = true
	```

3. And if it's greater than 0, we'll unflip it

	```gdscript
	elif(velocity.x > 0):
		animated_sprite_2d.flip_h = false
	```

4. Giving us a movement script that looks like this:

	```gdscript
	extends CharacterBody2D

	@export var speed = 200
	@onready var animated_sprite_2d = $AnimatedSprite2D

	func _physics_process(delta):
		var direction = Input.get_vector("Left", "Right", "Up", "Down")
		velocity = direction * speed 
		
		if velocity != Vector2.ZERO:
			animated_sprite_2d.play("walk")
		else:
			animated_sprite_2d.play("idle")
			
		if(velocity.x < 0):
			animated_sprite_2d.flip_h = true
		elif(velocity.x > 0):
			animated_sprite_2d.flip_h = false

		move_and_slide()
	```
	:::note[Flipping]
	Why didn't we juse use **else:**? - If we'd just used **Else:** our sprite would have jarringly flipped to face left whenever we stopped moving, or if we were just moving up and down. 
	This way the direction our sprite is facing doesn't change unless we move either left or right!
	:::

</Steps>
Test your game, and you'll notice your sprite now faces left or right depending on the direction we're facing!
