We've got a weapon, we've got health, we've got treasure to collect. What's missing?

Something to fight!

We'll be keeping our enemy fairly simple, it'll operate off a circular detection range, and walk toward the player if it enters that range, without taking into account walls (Though it will of course still collide with walls)

## Enemy Scene

Let's get to making the scene!

<Steps>

1. It'll need: a root **CharacterBody2D** (Called "Enemy") with three children: a **CollisionShape2D,** an **Area2D** (named "range") and an **AnimatedSprite2D**

	Additionally we'll want to give the **Area2D** a **CollisionShape2D** as a child.

	![Enemy Scene](/src/assets/godot/dungeonCrawler/enemyScene.png)

2. First, on the **CharacterBody2D** under the **Collision** section, we'll want **Layer** **2** and **3** selected. With only **3** selected under **Mask**

3. Let's skip down to setting up the **AnimatedSprite2D.** Create two animations, call the first "idle" and the second "move". Then, pick something to be your enemy! Selecting both the idle and move animation as we did for the player, using the **Add from file** button.

	You may want to speed the animations up as they're fairly slow by default, I found 10 fps to be good for both! You'll also want to make sure you set the **idle** animation to be autoplay!

4. Set the **CollisionShape2D** that's a child of the Root node to have a shape that generally matches the sprite.

5. Set the shape of the **CollisionShape2D** child of the **Area2D** to be a circle, making it however large you want the 'detection' range of the enemy to be!

6. Finally, let's create a new **Group** and call it "enemy", and assign it to the root node of the scene.

</Steps>

## Enemy Scripting

Now let's get the enemy moving!
<Steps>
1. Let's create some variables: 
	1. a boolean to keep track of if the player is in range
	2. a reference to the player
	3. a variable to control our speed

	It should look something like this, again getting the reference to the **AnimatedSprite2D** the usual way:
	```gdscript
	var in_range : bool = false
	var target

	@export var speed : float = 50.0
	@onready var animated_sprite_2d = $AnimatedSprite2D
	```

2. Then, we'll want to connect two signals from the "range" **Area2D** node, we'll want to connect both the "on_body_entered" and "on_body_exited" signals to the script we created!

	Let's write those functions. When the player enters the range, we'll want to set our **in_range** boolean, and play our move animation

	``` gdscript
	func _on_range_body_entered(body):
		if(body.is_in_group("player")):
			in_range = true
			target = body
			animated_sprite_2d.play("move")
	```

3. In the exited function, we'll want to do the inverse!

	```gdscript
	func _on_range_body_exited(body):
		if(body.is_in_group("player")):
			in_range = false
			animated_sprite_2d.play("idle")
	```

4. Now, in the **_process()** function, we'll want to check if our player is in range, if they are, move toward them. We'll also want to flip our sprite based on where the player is in relation to the enemy.

	```gdscript
	func _process(delta):
		if(in_range):

			velocity = (target.global_position - global_position).normalized() * speed

			if(target.global_position.x < global_position.x):
				animated_sprite_2d.flip_h = true
			else:
				animated_sprite_2d.flip_h = false

			move_and_slide()
	```

5. For a final script that looks like this:

	```gdscript

	extends CharacterBody2D

	var in_range : bool = false
	var target

	@export var speed : float = 50.0
	@onready var animated_sprite_2d = $AnimatedSprite2D

	# Called every frame. 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame.
	func _process(delta):
		if(in_range):
			
			velocity = (target.global_position - global_position).normalized() * speed
			
			if(target.global_position.x < global_position.x):
				animated_sprite_2d.flip_h = true
			else:
				animated_sprite_2d.flip_h = false
			move_and_slide()
			
		
	func _on_range_body_entered(body):
		if(body.is_in_group("player")):
			in_range = true
			target = body
			animated_sprite_2d.play("move")

	func _on_range_body_exited(body):
		if(body.is_in_group("player")):
			in_range = false
			animated_sprite_2d.play("idle")


	```
</Steps>

and that's it! The last thing we need to do is head over to our **Player** scene, create a group called "player" and add the root node of the scene to it.

Add an enemy to the scene, and you should notice that if you get close to it, it'll walk toward you, and take health away whenever it touches you! 

Although there's one problem... We can't destroy it!

## Destroying the enemy!

Head to your Weapon Scene and open the **weapon.gd** script. We'll just need to make some slight modifications to check if the sword is colliding with enemies when we attack.

<Steps>
1. First, let's get a reference to the **Area2D** node.

	```gdscript
	@onready var area_2d = $Sprite2D/Area2D
	```
2. Then, in our **_process()** function, if we're attacking, we'll want to get all the bodies we're colliding with and check if they're enemies.

	```gdscript
	if attacking:	
			for body in area_2d.get_overlapping_bodies():
				if body.is_in_group("enemy"):
					body.queue_free()
	```

3. Leaving the **_process():** function looking like this:

	```gdscript
	func _process(delta):
		look_at(get_global_mouse_position())
		
		if Input.is_action_just_pressed("Attack"):
			animation_player.play("Attack")
			
		if attacking:	
			for body in area_2d.get_overlapping_bodies():
				if body.is_in_group("enemy"):
					body.queue_free()
	```
</Steps>

Test it out, and hopefully you'll find you can now destroy the enemies!
