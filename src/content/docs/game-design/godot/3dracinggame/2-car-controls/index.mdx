## Adding a Camera & Light

To view the current progress, you'll need to insert a **Camera3D** node as a child of your Game node.
    :::tip[Positioning your camera]
        Use the green, red, and blue arrows to move the camera to an appropriate area overlooking the scene.
        
        
        Change the viewport angle (rotation x) to -45 degrees to make it look down. Make sure to save it!
    :::
If it's too dark, add a **DirectionalLight3D** and rotate it to face downwards.


Now, when you play from your "Game" scene, you should see the car fall down and bounce into place.

So far, you won't be able to control it -- this is on the next page.
