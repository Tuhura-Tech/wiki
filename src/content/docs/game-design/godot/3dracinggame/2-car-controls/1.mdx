## Adding a Script

You'll need to add a script onto your VehicleBody3D so you can customise and control your car.
...
## Adding Controls

To drive the car, you'll need to map these four inputs:
1. "Forward" -> W key.
1. "Backward" -> S key.
1. "Left" -> A key.
1. "Right" -> D key.

:::note
If you don't know how to do this, refer to [this 3D game resource](/game-design/godot/3dgame#changing-the-controls).
