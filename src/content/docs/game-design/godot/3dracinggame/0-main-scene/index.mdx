# Preview
:::note[If you're a beginner...]
Read through and implement [3D Game](/game-design/godot/3dgame) or [3D Intro](/game-design/godot/3d) until you know the basics of how 3D works in Godot.

You will be making a 3D racing game with a track, timer, lap counter, menu, and (of course) a race car!

# Setting up the main scene

<Steps>
1. Select **3D Scene** and rename to "Game".
2. Add a child **MeshInstance3D** and rename to "Ground". In the Inpector:
1. Select **New BoxMesh** under Mesh.
2. Click the BoxMesh and change the Size to (x: 50, y: 1, z: 50).
2. Still in the BoxMesh, under Material, select **New StandardMaterial3D**.
2. Find a road picture (preferably .png) so you can see where the car is going.
    - Download it into your racing game folder (I found mine here, on [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/content/cartoony-montainside-ii)).
    - In the Grounds' **Inspector > Mesh > Material > Albedo > Texture**, click 'Load' and select your texture.
    - You will also need to change this Size to (x: 50, y: 1, z: 50).

    - To make the texture repeat itself: **UV1 > Triplanar** to 'On'.
    - To make the texture not repeat as much, you can toggle with the  **UV1 > Scale** properties.
3. When on the Ground node, the menu bar will have a **Mesh** button.

    Create a collision shape and change **Collision shape placement** to `Static Body Child`.
4. Save your scene.
</Steps>

### Current Look
Your ground should now have repeated your picture and look something like this:
