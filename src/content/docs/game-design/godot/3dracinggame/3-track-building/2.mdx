## Adding in some of your heads up display

In order for us to know if we are at the finish line, we will need a display for the racer.
Ideally, this should include a lap counter, time, a finished screen and a crashed screen.

:::note[Godot Documentation]
Godot Documentation for nodes discussed in this section:
[Controls](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_control.html), [Labels](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_label.html#class-label), [Signals](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.html), and [Area3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_area3d.html).
:::

## Setting Up
<Steps>
1. Add a new scene, and add in a **Control** node. Name it "HUD".

    Under the **Layout > Anchors Preset** in the Inpsector, set this to **Full Rect**. This means the HUD will be the full size of the game screen.
    
    Drag this `hud.tscn` scene into the `car.tscn` scenes' top node (which should be **VehicleBody3D**).
2. In the HUD scene, add a **Panel** node. This will be the top display bar, showing the timer, laps, and if the car is reversing.

    :::note[2D views in a 3D game]
    You will need to go into the 2D view to be able to see the **Panel** and our future **ColorRect** nodes.
    This is because this layer will sit right at the front of all the other objects, and won't interfere with any of the cars' 3D nodes.
    This means in each of your third person cameras, this "HUD" will constantly sit at the front of the display.
    :::

    Change the sizing of this panel using the red dot anchors to be sitting on the top of the screen with full width.
    So we can see behind this panel: in **CanvasItem > Visibility > Modulate**, change the alpha (how transparent the object is) to halfway. And change the colour to your favourite colour!
0. Accessing our future labels

    :::note[Global Groups]
    A global group is a way to organize nodes dynamically under a label that you can access from anywhere in your project.
    This is found under the **Node** tab as **Groups**, where you can add nodes to a specific group name, enabling a powerful way
    to manage, interact with, and send commands to multiple nodes at once.
    :::

    Add a global group called `labels`, so that we can change each of the lap, timer and reverse labels in the scripts.
</Steps>

## Adding laps with a finish line
<Steps>
0. *In the `hud.tscn` scene:* Add a **Label** into the **Panel** node.
     - Rename it to `Laps`.
     - Set the text to `Laps: 1/3`.
     - Change the **scale** to `2`, to make it more visible.

1. Move it to the top left corner of the screen.

2. Add the `labels` group to the `Laps` label, you should see a rectangle with a circle inside it pop up next to its name in the scene bar.
3. *In the `track_1.tscn` scene:* Add a script on the **Node3D**.
3. ##### Making the finish line
    Create these nodes under the **Node3D** (the root).
        - **Area3D** (named "FinishLine")
            - **CollisionShape3D** (with a shape of **BoxShape3D**)
            - **MeshInstance3D** (with its mesh being **BoxMesh** and having a size of `x=8.5, y=1, z=2`)
                - Add a new **StandardMaterial3D** with a finish line picture like this (using the **Albedo** texture).

                ![Finish line picture to add into MeshInstance3D](/src/assets/godot/3DRacing/finishLine.png)

                You will need to play around with the **UV1**'s scale. The numbers I ended up with was `x=3, y=2.02, z=0`.
    
    Add a signal to "FinishLine" **Area3D** check whether the car has exited the area (so we will be able to check if the car has done a lap).
    To do this, you need to go in **Node > Signals** tab on the right, press `body_exited(body: Node3D)`, and click `Connect` down the bottom.

4. Inside our newly created script, add this code to update the laps each time. Make sure to read and understand the code!
    ```gdscript title="track_1.gd"
    # Variables to manage laps
    var maxLaps = 3     # Total laps to complete the race
    var currentLap = 1  # Current lap the vehicle is on

    # Variable to store references to all labels in the "labels" group
    var labels

    # Called when the node enters the scene tree for the first time
    func _ready() -> void:
        # Get all nodes in the "labels" group
        labels = get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("labels")

    # Called when the vehicle exits the finish line area (signal from finish line Area3D)
    func _on_finish_line_body_exited(body: Node3D) -> void:
        if body is VehicleBody3D: # Check if the body that exited is the vehicle
            # Check if the forward camera is active (not reversing into finish line)
            if body.camera_3d.current == true:
                # Check if the car hasn't finished
                if currentLap != maxLaps:
                    # Increase lap count, reset checkpoint flag, and update the lap label
                    currentLap += 1
                    var labelLaps = labels.filter(func(label): return label.name == "Laps")[0]
                    labelLaps.text = "Laps: " + str(currentLap) + "/" + str(maxLaps)
    ```
5. You will now be able to test it out, and each time you cross the finish line, the laps will increase!
</Steps>

:::caution
You will need to check the finish line Area3D is shaped for the width and height of the track and car.

:::

### Checkpoints
We will need more precise lap counting than just checking if the car is facing forward. Checkpoints across the track will help keep count of the actual laps the car has done.
<Steps>
1. Add the same nodes (*apart* from the MeshInstance3D) and a signal like the [finish line's](#making-the-finish-line).

    Name the **Area3D** "Checkpoint".

    These checkpoints will be invisible. You will need to put them around the track. For the sake of time, I have only added one 'halfway' checkpoint, but it is recommended to do more.
2. Then add this code to the connected function from the signal you made.
    ```gdscript title="track_1.gd"
    var passed_checkpoint = false # Flag to ensure vehicle passes a checkpoint before completing a lap
    # (exisiting code here)

    func _on_finish_line_body_exited(body: Node3D) -> void:
        if body is VehicleBody3D:
            # Check if the forward camera is active (no reversing into finish line) AND checkpoint has been passed
            if body.camera_3d.current == true && passed_checkpoint:
                # Check if the car hasn't finished
                if currentLap != maxLaps:
                    # (exisiting code here)
                    passed_checkpoint = false # Reset checkpoint flag for the next lap

    # Called when the vehicle exits a checkpoint area (signal from checkpoint Area3D)
    func _on_checkpoint_body_exited(body: Node3D) -> void:
        # Check if the vehicle is the one triggering the checkpoint and the main camera is active
        if body is VehicleBody3D && body.camera_3d.current == true:
            passed_checkpoint = true # Mark checkpoint as passed, allowing lap completion
    ```
3. Now, if you turn around before passing this checkpoint and go through the finish line, the lap counter won't increase!
</Steps>

## Adding a timer
<Steps>
1. To make a race car timer, we will need milliseconds, seconds, and minutes.
2. *In the `hud.tscn` scene:* Copy and paste the 'Laps' label.
    Rename it to `Time` and move it to the top right hand corner of the screen.
    Set the text to `Time: 00:00.000`.
3. Add this code to your existing code.
    If you understand the comments, feel free to delete them to reduce script clutter.
    ```gdscript title="track_1.gd"
    # Variables for timer
    var time = 0.0   # Total time elapsed since the start of the race in seconds
    var minutes = 0  # Minutes component of the time display
    var seconds = 0  # Seconds component of the time display
    var msec = 0     # Milliseconds component of the time display

    # Called every frame, where 'delta' is the elapsed time since the previous frame
    func _process(delta: float) -> void:
        # Update the total time by adding delta (time since last frame)
        time += delta
        
        # Calculate milliseconds, seconds, and minutes for time display
        msec = fmod(time, 1) * 100
        seconds = fmod(time, 60)
        minutes = fmod(time, 3600) / 60

        # Format the time as a string (MM:SS.mmm) for display
        var timeString = "%02d:%02d.%03d" % [minutes, seconds, msec]

        # Find the label displaying the time (assumes a label named "Time" is in the labels group)
        var labelTime = labels.filter(func(label): return label.name == "Time")[0]
        labelTime.text = timeString
    ```
4. Well done! You now have a working timer for your racing. Now you can see who the fastest race car driver is!
</Steps>

### Adding in a reverse state (optional)
<Steps>
1. If our car is still quite symmetrical, it would be easier to add in a reversing label so we can see if we are reversing or not.
2. *In the `hud.tscn` scene:* Copy and paste the 'Laps' label.
    Rename it to `Reversing` and move it next to the Laps label.
    Set the text to `Reversing...`.
    Set the colour to red.
    Uncheck the **Visible** (or the eye icon), as we only want it to show up when we reverse.
3. In our `car.gd` script, we will be able to put this label inside the script using our global group `labels`.
    ```gdscript title="car.gd"
    var labels
    var reverse_label
    # (existing variables)

    func _ready() -> void:
        camera_look_at = global_position
        # Find our labels group, and filter them until we've found our reverse label
        labels = get_tree().get_nodes_in_group("labels")
        reverse_label = labels.filter(func(label): return label.name == "Reversing")[0]

    # (existing functions)

    func _check_camera_switch():
        if linear_velocity.dot(transform.basis.z) > -1:
            camera_3d.current = true
            reverse_label.hide() # We're driving forward
        else:
            reverse_camera.current = true
            reverse_label.show() # We're reversing!
    ```
</Steps>

## Making the finished state

<Steps>
1. Once we've finished the race, we celebrate with a finish screen!
2. *In the `hud.tscn` scene:* Add a **ColorRect** node under the main **Control** node.
    - Rename it to `FinishedLevel` and change it's size to the whole screen.
    - Change the colour to transparent(ish) green.
    - Uncheck the **Visible** (or the eye icon), as we only want it to show up when we finish the track.
    - Add it to the `labels` global group (in **Node > Signals**).
    - Add a **Label** as a child of **ColorRect** and set the text to `You've finished the track!`. Set the **scale** to 3.
3. Inside our `track_1.gd`, make some changes to our `_on_finish_line_body_exited` function, and add in a `stop` function.

    ```gdscript title="track_1.gd"
        func _on_finish_line_body_exited(body: Node3D) -> void:
            if body is VehicleBody3D: # Check if the body that exited is the vehicle
                # Check if the main camera is active and checkpoint has been passed
                if body.camera_3d.current == true && passed_checkpoint:
                    # Check if the current lap is the last one
                    if currentLap == maxLaps:
                        # Display "Finished Level" label to indicate race completion
                        var finishedLevel = labels.filter(func(label): return label.name == "FinishedLevel")[0]
                        finishedLevel.show()
                        stop() # Stop processing further laps
                    else:
                        # Increase lap count, reset checkpoint flag, and update the lap label
                        currentLap += 1
                        var labelLaps = labels.filter(func(label): return label.name == "Laps")[0]
                        labelLaps.text = "Laps: " + str(currentLap) + "/" + str(maxLaps)
                        passed_checkpoint = false # Reset checkpoint flag for the next lap

        # Function to stop the timer and prevent further processing
        func stop() -> void:
            set_process(false)
    ```
</Steps>

## Making the crashed state

<Steps>
1. *In the `hud.tscn` scene:* Add a **ColorRect** node under the main **Control** node.
    - Rename it to `CrashedScreen` and change it's size to the whole screen.
    - Change the colour to transparent(ish) red.
    - Uncheck the **Visible** (or the eye icon), as we only want it to show up when we crash.
    - Add it to the `labels` global group (in **Node > Signals**).
    - Add a **Label** as a child of **ColorRect** and set the text to `You crashed! Restart the game.`. Set the **scale** to 3.
3. Inside our `car.gd`, make some changes to our `_physics_process` and `_ready` functions.

    ```gdscript title="car.gd"
    var crash_timer = 0.0
    var crash_threshold = 3.0 # Time in seconds before considering it crashed
    var crash_screen

    func _ready() -> void:
        # (exisiting code)
	    crash_screen = labels.filter(func(label): return label.name == "CrashedScreen")[0]

    func _physics_process(delta: float):
        # (exisiting code)
        # if the car has crashed: Check if the vehicle is upside down
        if transform.basis.y.dot(Vector3.UP) < 0:
            crash_timer += delta
            if crash_timer >= crash_threshold:
                crash_screen.show()
        else:
            crash_timer = 0.0 # Reset timer if not upside down

    ```
</Steps>
