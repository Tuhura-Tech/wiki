<Steps>
1. Add Node3D to World.
2. Add Path3D to Node3D
3. Move Ground below y=0.
4. When on Path3D, you'll notice that there are extra options in the nav bar.
    - Click on the green 'Add point' button.
    - Click on the Y Axis so that each of these points will be at the same height.
    - Add your points.
    - To finish, click the blue triangle 'close curve' button.
5. To make the path curved:
    - Click the 'select control points'
    - Hold shift and click each point to drag the control handles around.
    - It should something like this:

6. Move your path points up to make some hills:

7. #### To make the path visible:
    - Add **CSGPolygon** to Path3D.
    - Set the **Mode** to Path.
    - Assign the **Path Node** to the Path3D.
8. To change the shape of the path:
    - Click the Polygons' PackedVector2Array and you will see size 4 (we need 4 corners to make a rectangular path)
    - On each corner, the y will change the height of the path, and x will change the width of the path.
    - If you change corners 0 and 1 to have their x = -2, then corners 2 and 3 to have their x = 2, you will see the path widen.
    - If you leave corners 0 and 3 to have their y = 0, then change corners 1 and 2 to have their y = 0.1, the path will be thinner.
    - Now, move the car onto the track to see if the sizing of the path is good. If the sizing is bad, change the x and y to be wider or thicker, respectively.
9. To tilt the path (like if your end points haven't joined together properly)
    - ![photo of how to tilt](/src/assets/godot/3DRacing/tiltButton.png)
    - On Path3D, select the yellow circle button (which will then turn green) and then use the dots on each point to change each points' tilt.
    - If you see any points in the path which doesn't look 'smooth' enough, change the tilt.
10. In the CSGShape3D section, tick the **Use Collision** checkbox so the car can drive on the path.
</Steps>
Test it out and change the tilting, size, and height of the track if it's too hard to complete. I changed my path to be easier - I made the path wider by changing the x positions to be -4 and 4. I also deleted some path points so that the path is more like a circle so that the first track is easy.
If you want the road to have a texture like your Ground, inside the CSGPolygon3D, [follow the same steps, starting on step 5](/0-main-scene#setting-up-the-main-scene).

To make barriers around the road so the car doesn't go off track, we will need to add another CSGPolygon3D.
<Steps>
1. To do this, do the same steps as above [to make the path visible](#to-make-the-path-visible).
2. Check **Path Joined** and in CSGShape3D check the **Use Collision** checkbox.
3. Rename it to 'Road Barrier'.
4. We need the shape to have two rectangles following along the edges of the road. To do this, we need to change the size to be 8.
5. To make two rectangles from this, set the x & y coordinates like in this photo:
    - You will not see the polygon take shape until you've entered in all the corners positions'. ![Road Barrier coordinates](/src/assets/godot/3DRacing/barrierPositionNumbers.png)
6. Click the eye inside on the Road Barrier scene so that it isn't visible.
</Steps>

Test it out again!
