# Adding in your track
:::note[Godot Documentation]
Godot Documentation for nodes discussed in this section:
[Path3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_path3d.html), [CSGPolygon3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_csgpolygon3d.html)
:::
Click on the '+' button to create a new scene, and name it `track_1.tscn`.

<Steps>
1. Add a **Node3D**.
2. Add a **Path3D** to **Node3D**.
3. In your main scene with the ground, drag this saved track scene into the Ground (the top) node. You might notice that the path is below (or in line with) the ground. You will need to *decrease the y-position* of the ground.
4. Back in your track scene, you'll notice that **Path3D** has extra options in the navigation bar. Hover over each of them to get an understanding of what their functions are.

    - Click on the green **Add point** button.
    - Click on the Y Axis (the top right coloured axes) so that each of these points will be at the same height.
    - Add your points.
    - To finish, click the blue triangle **Close curve** button.
5. ###### Making the path curved
    - Click the **Select control points**.
    - Hold shift and click each point to drag the control handles around.
    - It should something like this inside the world scene:

6. ###### Making some hills

    Move your path points up using the green up arrow.

7. ###### Making the path visible
    - Add **CSGPolygon** to Path3D.
    - Set the **Mode** to Path.
    - Assign the **Path Node** to the Path3D.
8. ###### Changing the shape of the path
    - Click the Polygons' **PackedVector2Array** and you will see size 4 (we need 4 corners to make a rectangular path).
    :::note[Remember]
    The y will change the height of the path, and x will change the width of the path.
    :::
    These are the numbers I have entered in:
    ![PackedVector2Array's specific points](/src/assets/godot/3DRacing/pathMeasurements.png)
    <details>
    <summary>Explanation</summary>
    - If you change corners 0 and 1 to have their x = -5, then corners 2 and 3 to have their x = 5, you will see the path widen.
    - If you leave corners 0 and 3 to have their y = 0, then change corners 1 and 2 to have their y = 0.1, the path will be thinner.
    </details>

    - Now, move the car onto the track to see if the sizing of the path is good. If the sizing is bad, change the x and y to be wider or thicker, respectively.
9. ###### Tilting the path (if your end points haven't joined together properly)
    - ![photo of how to tilt](/src/assets/godot/3DRacing/tiltButton.png)
    - On Path3D, select the yellow circle button (which will then turn green) and then use the dots on each point to change each points' tilt.
    - If you see any points in the path which doesn't look 'smooth' enough, change the tilt.
10. In the CSGShape3D section, tick the **Use Collision** checkbox so the car can drive on the path.
11. ###### Creating a road-like texture
    - Inside the **CSGPolygon3D**, make a new **StandardMaterial3D** under **Material**.
    - Download this road picture [from OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/content/golgotha-textures-tunnelroadjpg). Rotate the picture.
    - Adjust the **Scale** under **UV1** to fit your path.
    It should look something like this (some path points have been deleted to make this first track easy).

11. Test it out and change the tilting, size, and height of the track if it's too hard to complete.
