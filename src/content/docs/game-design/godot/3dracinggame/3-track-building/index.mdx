1. Add Node3D to World.
2. Add Path3D to Node3D
3. Move Ground below y=0.
4. When on Path3D, you'll notice that there are extra options in the nav bar.
    - Click on the green 'Add point' button.
    - Click on the Y Axis so that each of these points will be at the same height.
    - Add your points.
    - To finish, click the blue triangle 'close curve' button.
5. To make the path curved:
    - Click the 'select control points'
    - Hold shift and click each point to drag the control handles around.
    - It should something like this:

6. Move your path points up to make some hills:

7. To make the path visible:
    - Add **CSGPolygon** to Path3D.
    - Set the **Mode** to Path.
    - Assign the **Path Node** to the Path3D.
8. To make the visible path thinner:
    - Click the Plygons' PackedVector2Array and change the 0 & 1 x position to -3.
