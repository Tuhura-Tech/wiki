# Adding in your car

:::note[Godot Documentation]
Godot Documentation for nodes discussed in this section:
[VehicleBody3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vehiclebody3d.html#vehiclebody3d), [VehicleWheel3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_vehiclewheel3d.html)
:::

### The Vehicle Body
<Steps>
1. Add a child **`VehicleBody3D`** node to Game. Make sure to move it above the ground.
1. Add a **`MeshInstance3D`** and make a **`New BoxMesh`**. Change this to a car shape (my Size is (1.5, 0.5, 3)).
1. On the menu bar **`Mesh`** button, create a collision shape. But this time, 
    
    **`Collision shape placement`** is `Sibling`. This is because the car needs to not be static.

    **`Collision Shape Type`** is `Simplified Convex`.
1. To change the colour of your car, go **MeshInstance3D > Mesh > Material > New StandardMaterial3D > Albedo** and change the colour.
1. Save your scene.

### The Vehicle Wheels
<Steps>
1. Add a child **`VehicleWheel3D`** node to VehicleBody3D and rename it to "FrontLeftWheel".
1. Using the X, Y, Z axes adjust the wheel location to be just outside the vehicle body.
1. In the Inspector:
    - Under **Wheel** change the **Radius** to 0.4m (or to a size which the light blue circle is bigger than your car body).
    - Under **Suspension** change the **Stiffness** to 50 (hover over the word 'Stiffness' to see Godots explanation).
    - Under **VehicleBody3D Motion** tick **Use as Steering** (as we want the front wheels to steer).
1. Add a child **MeshInstance3D** node and create a **New CylinderMesh**.
    - By clicking on the mesh instance, change the Top & Bottom Radius to the same as the Wheel Radius (0.4m).
    - Change the Height to 0.3m.
    - Under the **MeshInstance3D > Tranform**, set the **`Rotation z`** to **90** degrees.
1. Duplicate this wheel (ctrl/cmd D). Under the Transform tab, change the x-position to the negation of the current number. Rename it to "FrontRightWheel".
1. Select both these wheels and duplicate again, this time changing the z-position to its' negation. Rename them to "BackRightWheel" and "BackLeftWheel".
1. Set the back wheels' **VehicleBody3D Motion** to only tick **Use as Traction** (as we want the back wheels to accelerate).

## Checklist
<Checklist>
- [ ] I have a car body and four wheels.
- [ ] I understand how I can change the VehicleBody3D and VehicleWheel3D in the Inspector to suit my liking (e.g., if I want my wheels to be a different colour, or if I want the front wheels to accelerate too).
