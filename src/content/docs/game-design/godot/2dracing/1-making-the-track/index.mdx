## Making the Track

<Steps>

1. Give track1 a TileMapLayer and name it Foreground. This is where we'll make the track.

2. For the tileset, open the spritesheet_tiles.png. in the TileSet menu, set the texture region to 128 by 128 and in the inspector click on TileSet and change the tile size to 128 by 128.

    :::note
    You may get errors and crashing after changing the tile sizes. If so, click on the TileMapLayer node, go to the TileSet menu, click the 3 dots by the eraser symbol, and click "Remove Tiles Outside the Texture".
    :::

3. Now you can draw your own track.

4. If you want to make a background, create a new TileMapLayer by duplicating the foreground, and draw using that as your base.
