Now, go to the script on your player and add an `@onready` variable for the ray cast and label similar to how the `main_camera` is.
When you have `@onready var your_var_name =` you can just drag the node from the scene tree into the script, and it will automatically fill in the variable path and add $.

Next add the action for your interact button, like you did for the movement keys. E or F are good buttons for basic world interaction, and name it something like 'interact'.

Finally, somewhere in your `_physics_process(delta)` function, probably after the jumping code, check if the input action "interact" was pressed this frame.
If it was, get the collider from the ray cast and check if it's a valid instance, then check if it's in the "Button" group, and if it is set the label to visible.

```gdscript
if Input.is_action_just_pressed("interact"):
	var object = ray_cast.get_collider()
	if is_instance_valid(object):
		if object.is_in_group("Button"):
			label.visible = true
```

Boom! Interaction.

<Box>
## Scripted Button
<Checklist>
- [ ] Added raycast variable.
- [ ] Added label variable.
- [ ] Add interact action.
- [ ] Add in script to _physics_process.
- [ ] Play your game.
</Checklist>
</Box>

Now if you play the game, look at the cube, and press your interaction button it should show text on screen.
This is a game. What you have made is a game. It might not look like it, but if you had beautiful art it would.

If you made some 3D models of platforms, a button, a character, and added a skybox it would look like a real game. That's truly the only difference. Well, that, and maybe a goal.

Next you should go join a [game jam](https://itch.io/jams) or go through our [3D racing game](/src/content/docs/game-design/godot/3dracinggame/0-main-scene/) tutorial!
