Now that you have a player, you need more platforms to jump on.
Copy the **StaticBody3D** node and paste it as a child of **Node3D**.

Press R to change to scale mode and enlarge the **StaticBody3D** with the green square, use Shift to scale equally on all sides.  
While we're at it, use E to rotate the platform slightly and W to move it to the side so you have to jump to get to the platform.

You can go back to the select tool with Q.

Play the game and now you have another platform!

Although, if you're paying attention, you might notice the warning sign on the **StaticBody3D**.
To fix this, reset the size of your **StaticBody3D** by either pressing CTRL+Z or selecting the reset button in the inspector on the scale, which is found under **Node3D > Transform**.

Then select the **MeshInstance3D** and use scale mode to increase its size, and then select the **CollisionShape3D** with select mode and use the orange dots to increase its size to match the **MeshInstance3D**.

You might notice the collision shape is changing both collision shapes, for this new platform and the original one.
To fix that you'll need to select the **CollisionShape3D** and make a new **BoxShape3D** in the inspector since it's still using the same **BoxShape3D** as the previous platform.

A better way of making multiple platforms is to save the platform as a scene and then copy paste the scene.  
Save either platform as a scene by right clicking the static body and selecting **Save Branch as Scene**.
