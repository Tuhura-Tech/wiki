Pressing a button is a little tricky, there's more that goes into pressing a button in a 3D environment than you thought, and more than you will have to do.

Let's make a simple button that makes some text appear on the screen.

## The text

First, the text. As a child of **Camera3D**, add **Label**.
Give the label some text and move it to the center of the feint camera box.

It should look something like this:
![Label](/src/assets/godot/3D/Label.png)
Feel free to change the label to a **RichTextLabel** and mess around with making it look pretty.

After making your text, select your label and, in the inspector, go to **CanvasItem > Visibility** and turn **Visible** off, we will be making it visible with code.

## The button and raycast

Add a new **StaticBody3D**, with a mesh and collider.
The only difference this time is to make it a floating cube instead of a plane.

Select your new static body and go to the **Node** tab, which is found next to the inspector tab.
Go to groups and type in "Button" and press **Add**.

Add a **RayCast3D** as a child of your **Camera3D** and move it to aim in the same direction as the camera and move it to the same position as where the camera originates.  
Your button and ray cast should look something like this:
![Button and ray cast](/src/assets/godot/3D/RayCastButton.png)
Then, decrease the ray cast's target position's y to -3 or lower.
