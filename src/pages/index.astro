NOTE: The following code used to be included in a script tag on the page.
However, our english translations are now far more developed than any other language.
We are going to start a process of updating our translations, and can begin to opt-in
to different language automatic redirects once they hit a certain quality threshold.
Until then, we'll just only redirect to english for now, with the meta tag below

// WIP: trigger a client-side redirect based on the browser language.
// A vercel.json redirect is enforced in production, so no user should ever see this page.
// Remove the vercel.json redirect when this is ready.
const KNOWN_LANGUAGES = ['en', 'mi'];
let newLangWithRegion = (window.navigator.userLanguage || window.navigator.language || 'en-US').substr(0, 5);
let newLang = newLangWithRegion.substr(0, 2);
if (KNOWN_LANGUAGES.includes(newLangWithRegion)) {
	window.location.pathname = '/' + newLangWithRegion + '/landing';
} else if (KNOWN_LANGUAGES.includes(newLang)) {
	window.location.pathname = '/' + newLang + '/landing';
} else {
	window.location.pathname = '/en/landing';
